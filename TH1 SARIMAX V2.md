**INTRODUCTION**

## **1.1 Introduction Of The Problem** {#1.1-introduction-of-the-problem}

Energy consumption is one of the leading contributors to global environmental degradation and climate change, affecting millions of lives, especially in underserved regions. The proposed energy monitoring and forecasting system has a significant social impact in addressing the financial burden of electricity costs for Filipino households, particularly low- to middle-income families. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (2023), electricity expenses represent one of the largest monthly expenditures for households, with rates among the highest in Southeast Asia, averaging ₱11.743 per kilowatt-hour in 2025 (GlobalPetrolPrices.com, 2025). The lack of real-time visibility into appliance-level consumption leaves consumers unable to identify which devices contribute most to their energy bills, leading to inefficient consumption, unexpected high bills, and wasted energy. As Respicio & Co. (2024) noted, these unresolved issues underscore the need for more transparent energy management practices, particularly in residential areas. These challenges directly relate to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), which emphasizes the need to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and SDG 13 (Climate Action), which calls for efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change through more sustainable energy practices (Bertheau, 2024).

In the Philippines, where energy consumption patterns are often misjudged, particularly among households in underserved regions, the introduction of real-time, appliance-level monitoring systems becomes crucial. Research has shown that households significantly misestimate their energy usage, especially with regard to lighting and cooling devices (Baidoo et al., 2021). These gaps in perception demonstrate the need for a granular energy monitoring system that allows consumers to visualize and control their consumption more effectively.

Despite the growing energy demand driven by modern appliances, remote work, and increasingly digital lifestyles, traditional electric meters still only provide a single monthly reading, with no breakdown by appliance or usage behavior. The shift toward smart grids and more sustainable energy practices presents an opportunity to address the growing demand for energy while reducing its environmental impact. However, residential energy management remains underdeveloped, particularly in developing countries like the Philippines. Real-time energy consumption forecasting and cost estimation are essential for efficient resource allocation and cost-saving strategies, yet the technology remains underutilized.

In tackling this issue, forecasting models such as ARIMA have long been used for energy consumption prediction. In the Philippines, studies by Caw-it and Talirongan (2025) and Uayan (2024) have demonstrated the effectiveness of ARIMA-based models in predicting short-term energy consumption. ARIMA models are particularly useful for capturing seasonal consumption patterns, making them beneficial for residential energy planning. However, ARIMA has limitations, particularly its inability to account for dynamic seasonality and external factors such as ambient temperature, time of day, and holidays, which are critical variables that significantly affect energy consumption patterns. This limitation makes ARIMA inadequate for long-term energy forecasting, where seasonal variations play a significant role.

Building upon ARIMA's shortcomings, SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMAX) addresses some of these limitations by integrating seasonal adjustments and external variables, making it a more robust tool for energy forecasting. Studies by Cecílio, Rodrigues, Barros, and de Sá (2025) show that SARIMAX can improve forecasting accuracy by considering factors like weather conditions and tariff rates, which are essential for forecasting energy consumption costs. Despite its improvements, SARIMAX still faces challenges in handling dynamic seasonality adjustments, which are necessary for addressing fluctuations caused by seasonal weather changes or varied appliance usage during peak periods.

To address the challenge of having only two months of high-frequency household energy data, this study integrates an Improved TimeGAN architecture to reconstruct the missing twelve months of 10-minute interval consumption. Recent advancements in time-series data augmentation highlight the capability of GAN-based models to generate realistic synthetic sequences that preserve temporal structure, particularly under limited-data conditions. For example, Zhang et al. (2025) demonstrate that TimeGAN-based augmentation can effectively mitigate imbalanced and small-sample distributions in building electricity datasets by generating high-quality virtual samples that align closely with real consumption patterns. Building on this direction, the enhanced model of Tang et al. (2025) incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism in the recovery network, enabling more accurate extraction of long-range consumption dependencies even under small-sample constraints. This approach is further supported by the findings of Chen et al. (2024), who show that deep generative models can significantly improve data representativeness and stability when real-world time-series samples are limited, noisy, or incomplete. By generating realistic daily household load profiles and later aligning them with actual Meralco monthly kWh values, the Improved TimeGAN provides the complete year-long dataset required for accurate appliance-level forecasting and cost estimation using SARIMAX.

This gap in existing research presents an opportunity for innovation. While several international and local studies (Caw-it and Talirongan, 2025; Khan and Ahmad, 2023; Jamil et al., 2024; Nguyen and Lee, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022\) have demonstrated the technical feasibility of energy forecasting systems, many of these models remain either too complex, internet-dependent, or inaccessible for ordinary households. These limitations make them less suitable for Filipino families, sectors that are currently underserved by existing energy technologies. By integrating appliance-level forecasting and applying SARIMAX on high-frequency 10-minute data collected through commercially available Wi-Fi-enabled devices with built-in energy monitoring, we bridge the gap between complex industrial solutions and limited household tools. Additionally, we introduce a budget alert system to notify users when their energy consumption exceeds preset limits, providing real-time cost management and control over electricity bills.

Additionally, we introduce a budget alert system to notify users when their energy consumption exceeds preset limits, providing real-time cost management and control over electricity bills. 

**1.2 Problem Statement**  
Many Filipino households continue to face challenges in managing their electricity expenses due to the limited availability of practical tools that can monitor, analyze, and predict energy consumption at the appliance level. Conventional electric meters provide only a total monthly figure, which leaves users unaware of how much electricity each appliance contributes to their overall consumption. This lack of visibility hinders their ability to identify high-consuming devices, manage their budgets effectively, and make well-informed decisions that could help reduce energy costs.

Most households are unable to monitor the timely energy consumption of individual appliances with granular detail, which makes it difficult to determine which specific devices are responsible for driving up their electricity bills. Families often rely on assumptions or guesswork, such as believing that lighting contributes most to their expenses, when in reality large appliances like refrigerators, air conditioning units, or computers may account for the majority of energy use. Without accurate, appliance-level monitoring from a high-frequency source, households are left in the dark about their true consumption patterns, limiting their capacity to make adjustments that could lower their costs.

Another pressing problem is the absence of budget tracking and alert systems for household energy use. Consumers generally have no mechanism that informs them when their electricity consumption is nearing or exceeding a self-imposed budget for the day, week, or month. As a result, many households are caught off guard by unexpectedly high bills at the end of the month. This not only disrupts financial planning but also creates stress for families, particularly those from low-income to middle-income backgrounds who must manage tight budgets.

In addition, households currently lack access to forecasting tools that could provide them with a reasonable estimate of their future electricity costs. Without the ability to project their upcoming bills based on current usage trends and seasonal patterns, consumers are unable to anticipate expenses or adjust their energy consumption proactively. This challenge is further compounded by the limited availability of long-term appliance-level datasets, which this study addresses by reconstructing additional months of historical data using a generative model.

### **1.2.1 Research Questions** {#1.2.1-research-questions}

This study is guided by the following specific research questions:

1. How can a high-frequency energy monitoring system using Tuya smart sockets help Filipino households track and manage their appliance-level energy consumption?  
2. How can Improved TimeGAN be used to reconstruct missing historical appliance-level data to support accurate SARIMAX forecasting?  
3. How can the SARIMAX algorithm be applied to forecast hourly electricity consumption and estimate the associated costs for households?  
4. How can a budget tracking and alert system be designed to notify users when they are projected to exceed cost limits?

## **1.3 Research Objectives** {#1.3-research-objectives}

The main objective of this study is to implement a low-cost home energy monitoring system that provides high-frequency appliance-level data forecasting, budget tracking, and cost estimation using Tuya smart sockets and the SARIMAX algorithm.

1. To design a high-frequency monitoring system using Tuya smart sockets that measures and displays the energy consumption of individual appliances through an interactive dashboard.  
2. To generate a complete year-long appliance-level dataset for forecasting model training and validation by reconstructing missing historical data using an Improved TimeGAN architecture.  
3. To implement a forecasting system for hourly energy consumption based on the SARIMAX algorithm, with cost estimation derived from the forecasted values.  
4. To develop a budget tracking feature that allows users to set daily electricity consumption limits and integrates an alert system that notifies them when usage approaches or exceeds these thresholds.

This study proposes the Home Energy Consumption Forecasting with High-Frequency Tuya Smart Socket Integration and Enhanced SARIMAX Forecasting Algorithm, a low-cost and accessible platform that integrates algorithmic intelligence into an energy monitoring system. The proposed system employs commercially available Tuya smart sockets with Wi-Fi connectivity to enable plug-and-play, appliance-level monitoring and cloud-assisted data acquisition. The forecasting component uses the SARIMAX model to forecast hourly appliance-level electricity consumption and cost for the next twenty-four hours.This model is trained on a 14-month dataset consisting of two months of real appliance-level readings and twelve months of synthetically reconstructed data. The system features a web dashboard with visualizations, detailed logs, and budgeting tools, complemented by a mobile interface that provides simplified notifications on forecasted electricity costs and appliance-level contributions. Through this integrated design, the system delivers a scalable, and user-centered approach to household energy visualization and forecasting.

## **1.4 Significance Of The Study** {#1.4-significance-of-the-study}

Upon completion of this thesis, homeowners are expected to benefit through visibility of their future appliance-level electricity consumption. By having clearer insights into which devices contribute most to their energy usage, they can make more informed decisions in scheduling appliance operations, preventing overconsumption, and ultimately lowering their monthly electricity expenses.

Researchers will be able to apply their knowledge in computer science, particularly in integrating commercial IoT devices such as Tuya smart sockets, building web-based visualizers, and implementing forecasting algorithms such as SARIMAX and rule-based alerts. 

Homeowners will have access to a user-friendly platform that displays forecasted data on energy consumption per appliance. This empowers users to track their electricity behavior and take immediate action to save costs.

Small business owners will gain a more reliable way to monitor electricity usage per appliance compared to relying solely on a sub-meter, which only shows total consumption. This feature can help identify which equipment consumes the most power, and support cost-saving decisions to improve small business operations.

Students and schools can use this research as a reference for developing similar projects in electronics, computer science, or environmental studies. It demonstrates how forecasting algorithms can be used to solve real-world problems and promote energy awareness.

Future researchers can build upon this project as a foundation for more advanced systems, such as web-based energy dashboards, predictions for cost estimation, or integration with home automation platforms.

The environment will benefit from the system by encouraging responsible energy use through increased awareness and reduced unnecessary electricity consumption.

## **1.5 Scope And Delimitations** {#1.5-scope-and-delimitations}

This section outlines the boundaries, extent, and limitations of the system developed in this study. It clarifies what the research includes, such as the design of an appliance-level monitoring and forecasting system using Tuya smart sockets, synthetic data reconstruction, and SARIMAX forecasting, and what falls outside its intended coverage.

### **1.5.1 Scope of the Study** {#1.5.1-scope-of-the-study}

This study focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of an appliance-level Home Energy Consumption Forecasting and Cost Estimation System that integrates Tuya Wi-Fi Smart Sockets, a cloud-based data pipeline, and a SARIMAX forecasting algorithm. The system is specifically designed for Filipino households, which operate under the Meralco residential tariff structure. Its purpose is to provide monitoring, short-term cost forecasting, and budget alerts that can help users manage electricity consumption more efficiently and gain awareness of their energy usage patterns.

The system measures appliance-level electricity usage through SMATRUL Tuya Smart Sockets, which transmit data to the Tuya Cloud API at ten-minute intervals. The recorded data are retrieved by a Python-based logger hosted on a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to ensure continuous operation even without local computer access. The system also integrates hourly weather data from OpenWeatherMap and Meteostat APIs, along with monthly tariff rates from official Meralco advisories. In addition, because only two months of high-frequency measurements were available, the study integrates a synthetic data generation stage using Improved TimeGAN to reconstruct the remaining historical months needed for seasonal forecasting. These datasets are combined to form the inputs for the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous Variables) model, which forecasts hourly appliance-level electricity consumption and cost for the next twenty-four hours. The resulting forecasts are visualized on a dashboard that presents historical and projected energy data, estimated costs, top-consuming appliances, and budget status alerts.

Model performance is assessed through standard quantitative metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Determination (R²). Diagnostic tests such as the Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), and Ljung–Box Q-test are used to confirm that model residuals behave as white noise, validating model adequacy. Testing is limited to selected household appliances chosen for their common and practical relevance in everyday energy consumption. The forecasting horizon is short-term, focusing on hourly forecasts within a 24-hour window to support daily household energy management and budget planning.  
The study’s scope is methodological rather than demographic. It does not seek to generalize findings to a broader population of households or regions. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating a replicable methodological framework for appliance-level forecasting and cost estimation using real data from a single monitored household. The aim is to validate the system’s capability and reliability, which can later be adapted and scaled to other households with similar data availability. The system is evaluated using data collected from a single residential household to demonstrate feasibility, reliability, and methodological validity.

### **1.5.2 Delimitations of the Study** {#1.5.2-delimitations-of-the-study}

	The study is limited to a single participating household, and the findings are not intended to represent electricity consumption behavior across all households in Parañaque, Metro Manila. The system is also limited to devices compatible with Tuya Smart Sockets operating within standard single-phase 220–240 V AC electrical systems. It does not include automatic appliance control or remote shutdown features, as its purpose is limited to monitoring, forecasting, and notification. The synthetic dataset generated through TimeGAN serves only as a reconstructed historical approximation and not as a replacement for real consumption data. Its use is limited to model training and is validated statistically to ensure realism. The forecasting component employs only the SARIMAX algorithm, excluding more complex deep learning methods such as LSTM or CNN to maintain interpretability and computational efficiency. The implementation is geographically restricted to Metro Manila and nearby areas under Meralco’s tariff structure; therefore, results may not directly apply to regions with different pricing schemes or energy policies.  
Furthermore, the system cannot monitor appliances that are not individually connected to a Tuya Smart Socket, nor can it handle high-voltage or industrial environments. Its performance depends on the continuity of Wi-Fi connectivity and data logging; interruptions, power outages, or user-related behavior changes may introduce gaps in data collection. Finally, while the current version focuses on data visualization, forecasting, and alerting, several features, such as mobile app integration, exportable consumption logs, and enhanced long-term analytics, are identified as potential future enhancements and fall outside the present scope of this prototype.

## **2.1 Integrating IoT for Appliance-Level Energy Monitoring and Forecasting** {#2.1-integrating-iot-for-appliance-level-energy-monitoring-and-forecasting}

	This review synthesizes the work of various studies that provide a basis for integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cloud-based platforms, and external data sources in building datasets for energy forecasting. A successful system must strike a balance between sensor accuracy, data integrity, and contextual enrichment, as all these factors are critical for high-accuracy energy forecasting. Our study builds upon these approaches by integrating a more comprehensive data collection framework tailored to the specific needs of residential energy forecasting and cost estimation in the Philippine context.

### **2.1.1 Smart Plug Technology and Measurement Accuracy** {#2.1.1-smart-plug-technology-and-measurement-accuracy}

The use of smart plug technology is at the core of appliance-level energy monitoring, enabling the collection of real-time power data for energy forecasting. The studies by Condon et al. (2023) and Ahmed et al. (2022) demonstrate the practical deployment of commodity smart plugs, specifically the Sonoff POW R2, for continuous monitoring in residential and campus settings, respectively. These studies highlight the viability of using affordable, widely available smart plugs as sensors for real-time data acquisition.

In Condon et al. (2023), the researchers implemented a cloud-based Home Energy Management System (HEMS) using Sonoff POW R2 smart plugs connected to the AWS IoT platform, sampling data at 10-second intervals. This approach successfully demonstrates the integration of cloud ingestion and analytics, emphasizing how commodity smart plugs can contribute to scalable energy management systems. Similarly, Ahmed et al. (2022) explored a campus-scale system using the same Sonoff plugs, further validating their feasibility for data collection. Both studies confirm that smart plugs are a cost-effective and practical solution for appliance-level monitoring.

However, a critical gap emerges in these studies regarding measurement accuracy. Santos et al. (2023) identified that smart plugs, including the Sonoff POW R2, can introduce measurement errors of up to ±3%, particularly under dynamic loads. This error can result in incorrect energy consumption readings, which may lead to misleading conclusions in forecasting models if not properly addressed. Moreover, these studies do not specifically address how such measurement inaccuracies are mitigated, making it an important consideration for future work.

In response, our study addresses these accuracy issues by selecting certified SMATRUL Tuya Smart Sockets. These plugs are specifically chosen for their known performance under varying loads, and we further mitigate inaccuracies by implementing a Physics Consistency and Scaling Verification process. By recomputing power consumption from raw voltage and current readings and validating the results against expected standards, we ensure data integrity and correct for potential device-specific errors before the data is used in forecasting models.

**2.1.2 Cloud-Based Architectures and Data Pipelines**  
	A robust cloud infrastructure plays a critical role in managing the high volume of real-time data generated by IoT devices. Several studies, including Condon et al. (2023) and Ahmed et al. (2022), highlight the importance of cloud integration in facilitating data ingestion and storage, crucial for large-scale energy management systems. Both studies utilize cloud platforms for data storage and real-time data flow, yet they overlook some important issues related to service interruptions, data storage format, and scalability.

In Condon et al. (2023), a real-home Home Energy Management System (HEMS) is implemented using Sonoff POW R2 smart plugs with AWS IoT, capturing data at a 10-second interval for appliance-level energy consumption. Similarly, Ahmed et al. (2022) explore a campus-scale system with the same type of smart plugs, validating the feasibility of using commodity devices for continuous data collection. These studies prove that smart plug-based systems are viable for cloud data ingestion and analysis, but both systems lack a clearly defined and lightweight storage mechanism for organizing data.

To address this gap, our study adopts a Python-based logger that operates continuously on a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM). This system retrieves data from the Tuya Cloud API and stores it in CSV files, ensuring that the data is easily accessible for time-series modeling and further analysis. Additionally, our system includes a fallback estimation mechanism, which interpolates missing data points during brief network or API interruptions, thus ensuring uninterrupted data flow despite potential service disruptions.

### **2.1.3 Optimal Sampling Frequency for Energy Data** {#2.1.3-optimal-sampling-frequency-for-energy-data}

The frequency at which energy consumption data is sampled is pivotal in capturing accurate appliance-level energy usage patterns, which are essential for both forecasting and detecting appliance behavior. The Plegma dataset (Athanasoulias et al., 2024), which records appliance-level energy usage at 10-second intervals, represents the highest resolution of data in appliance monitoring. This fine granularity enables a detailed analysis of energy consumption fluctuations, making it highly relevant to studies focusing on energy demand forecasting and appliance detection. However, for practical applications, particularly those limited by data storage and transmission constraints, higher frequency sampling may not always be feasible.

In contrast, studies like Hernandez et al. (2020) and Petralia et al. (2023) explore the impact of different sampling rates on energy consumption accuracy. Hernandez et al. (2020) found that sampling intervals greater than 10 minutes can lead to significant data loss, particularly during peak load periods. Their study suggests that 5-minute sampling intervals offer a good balance between capturing household load features and minimizing the computational overhead. Meanwhile, Petralia et al. (2023) support the adoption of 10-minute intervals for detecting appliances effectively, especially in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) applications, where resolution beyond 10 minutes might not yield substantial improvements in accuracy but could increase data volume unnecessarily.

To reconcile the ideal sampling frequency with the practical constraints of IoT devices, we adopt a 10-minute sampling cadence, aligning with the capabilities of the Tuya Cloud API while still maintaining an appropriate resolution for appliance detection and time-series forecasting. This approach ensures that we capture the necessary energy usage patterns without overloading the system with excessive data, which could compromise long-term sustainability. The 10-minute cadence has been validated by Petralia et al. (2023) and demonstrates an effective balance between capturing essential energy consumption behaviors and ensuring scalability, as evidenced by Hernandez et al. (2020), who also advocate for such a cadence in residential energy consumption studies.

### **2.1.4 Integrating Exogenous Variables and Local Context** {#2.1.4-integrating-exogenous-variables-and-local-context}

Forecasting accuracy in energy consumption modeling can be significantly enhanced by integrating exogenous variables such as weather data and electricity tariff rates. Studies in sales forecasting (Chen et al., 2025\) and energy forecasting (Santos, 2021\) highlight the effectiveness of SARIMAX models in leveraging external factors to improve forecasting accuracy. Ampountolas (2021) and Santos (2021) specifically demonstrate the benefits of integrating weather-related variables, such as temperature, and electricity prices, for improving the precision of energy demand forecasts. Additionally, Liu et al. (2023) examined the impact of weather on industrial and commercial energy consumption, offering valuable insights into how extreme weather conditions can influence energy demand. This aligns with our approach of integrating weather data into energy forecasting, particularly during extreme weather events, which can help guide the inclusion of such data in residential energy consumption models. Furthermore, a recent study by Aguirre-Fraire et al. (2024) offers an extensive dataset that integrates household energy consumption with weather data collected, which includes one-minute interval data for household energy consumption and weather metrics from the OpenWeatherMap API.

However, these studies tend to focus on aggregate-level forecasting, leaving a gap in understanding how appliance-specific data can enhance forecasting accuracy. For example, while Santos (2021) focuses on aggregate demand in the Philippines, it does not account for how data at the appliance level can significantly improve predictions. Moreover, many international datasets do not consider crucial local weather factors, such as rainfall, which has a pronounced effect on energy consumption, especially in tropical climates like the Philippines. Furthermore, Liu et al’s study focuses on industrial/commercial datasets with 15-minute intervals and it lacks the residential appliance-level granularity and the tariff/cost data integration we include. 

To bridge these gaps, our study brings the industrial/commercial scale weather impacts down to the residential appliance level. It will also extend the focus from aggregate-level to appliance-level forecasting by incorporating real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, which includes temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Additionally, we integrate Meralco Tariff Data, which enables accurate cost estimation based on local electricity rates. The inclusion of these local tariff and weather variables not only improves the forecasting accuracy but also allows for precise cost estimations for individual appliances. This approach addresses shortcomings in previous studies, which often overlook these key factors.

## **2.2. Enhancing Appliance-Level Energy Forecasting through Data Integrity, Cleaning, and Feature Engineering** {#2.2.-enhancing-appliance-level-energy-forecasting-through-data-integrity,-cleaning,-and-feature-engineering}

	This review synthesizes key studies focused on the preprocessing, cleaning, and standardization of energy data collected from smart plugs and weather sources, which form the foundation for accurate appliance-level energy forecasting. Accurate preprocessing ensures that raw data is physically consistent, temporally continuous, and synchronized with environmental conditions, which is important for downstream forecasting and cost estimation tasks. The following sections discuss how previous works have addressed various stages of data preparation and how our study builds upon them, extending their methods to achieve higher levels of granularity, accuracy, and applicability in the Philippine context.

### **2.2.1 Data Integrity Verification and Standardization for Appliance-Level Forecasting** {#2.2.1-data-integrity-verification-and-standardization-for-appliance-level-forecasting}

Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and synchronization of energy data from smart plugs and weather sensors is important for high-accuracy appliance-level energy forecasting. Several studies emphasize the importance of data integrity in energy forecasting, highlighting techniques for validating unit consistency, timestamps, and physical parameters. Chen et al. (2025) and Eirinaki et al. (2022) demonstrate that structured data preprocessing improves the robustness of forecasting models like SARIMAX and LSTM, which is particularly essential for appliance-level data that can involve complex and heterogeneous data sources. Dhaou (2023) discusses the need for physical consistency in smart plug measurements, focusing on RMS values, power factor, and voltage/current scaling, which is crucial for eliminating measurement errors in the forecasting pipeline. Similarly, Mystakidis et al. (2024) discuss the role of statistical normalization and interval aggregation in energy forecasting accuracy. Neumann et al. (2023) delve into weather data preprocessing, which also plays a significant role in improving forecasting performance when combined with appliance-specific data.

However, these studies often focus on aggregate-level or broader system-level data, leaving gaps in appliance-level forecasting, where multiple devices and external factors such as weather data must be harmonized with appliance-specific energy consumption readings. For instance, while Chen et al. (2025) focus on electricity sales forecasting, their approach does not consider appliance-level granularity or the integration of weather data with smart plug readings. Dhaou (2023) addresses physical consistency but does not extend this approach to include integration with external data sources like weather or the finer granularity required for residential appliance-level forecasting. Additionally, Eirinaki et al. (2022) focus on time-resolution conformance but do not implement the rigorous validation and schema checks necessary for appliance-level granularity.

To address these gaps, our study applies unit standardization, gap handling, and tolerance rules at a 10-minute interval for appliance-level data, extending the methods proposed by Chen et al. (2025) and Eirinaki et al. (2022) to the appliance-specific level. We enhance Dhaou's (2023) physical consistency approach by incorporating power factor recalculations and applying a ±5% tolerance rule, ensuring that each appliance’s data is physically consistent before model integration. Furthermore, we integrate external data sources like weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring synchronization of both energy and environmental data. Our approach improves data integrity through cross-source validation, physical consistency checks, and rigorous schema enforcement, addressing the limitations observed in previous studies, especially with respect to appliance-specific data.

### **2.2.2 Advanced Data Cleaning and Energy Derivation Techniques** {#2.2.2-advanced-data-cleaning-and-energy-derivation-techniques}

Data cleaning and energy derivation are critical in transforming raw energy consumption data into reliable datasets suitable for forecasting models. Several studies have explored different methods for handling missing data, outliers, and cumulative data, each contributing to improving forecasting accuracy. Ünal et al. (2021) formalized methods for time-interval validation and outlier removal, demonstrating how these techniques improve load forecasting accuracy when applied to smart meter data. Their approach emphasizes the importance of interval validation and handling outliers, which is a foundational step in preparing data for forecasting models. Similarly, Arvanitidis & Bargiotas (2022) introduced normalization and interpolation techniques, showing that these methods improve the accuracy of forecasting models by ensuring the data is in a consistent format for machine learning algorithms.

Weber et al. (2021) proposed the Copy-Paste Imputation (CPI) method, specifically designed for energy time series data. This method addresses the problem of missing data by copying and pasting similar data blocks, preserving the total energy of the missing segments. Their method is highly effective for maintaining the continuity and accuracy of the data by ensuring that the total energy consumed during the missing periods remains unchanged. Schaffer et al. (2022) introduced a method for converting cumulative energy data into interval-based energy values, a necessary step for many forecasting models. This conversion process ensures that cumulative data, often recorded by smart meters, is appropriately transformed into interval energy consumption values, facilitating more accurate forecasting.

However, despite these advancements, a gap remains in addressing the specific challenges posed by missing data over extended periods and handling cumulative resets or outages that often distort the energy consumption readings.

Our study addresses these gaps by adopting a hybrid decision rule for validating interval energy, which combines direct energy measurements and fallback energy estimates. We introduce a tolerance-based comparison (±10%) for validating missing data, which ensures that any missing data does not lead to significant inaccuracies in energy predictions. Furthermore, we apply a reprocessing mechanism for cumulative resets, which effectively handles energy data that may be interrupted or reset during data collection. By incorporating physical verification such as power factor recalculations and scaling validation for each appliance, we ensure that the data maintains its physical integrity, addressing the shortcomings observed in Weber et al. (2021) and Schaffer et al. (2022). This method not only corrects for errors in energy data but also helps to fill gaps in a way that preserves both energy consistency and forecasting accuracy, which is critical when dealing with residential appliance-level data.

### **2.2.3 Hourly Aggregation and Feature Engineering for Enhanced Forecasting** {#2.2.3-hourly-aggregation-and-feature-engineering-for-enhanced-forecasting}

Effective aggregation of energy data from high-resolution intervals, 10-minute intervals, to hourly totals, along with the creation of additional temporal features, plays a critical role in enhancing forecasting models. Schaffer et al. (2022) demonstrated how cumulative-to-interval energy derivation is crucial for transforming energy data into usable time-series for forecasting. Their study, which focused on hourly data from smart heat meters, laid the groundwork for understanding the need for accurate aggregation in energy demand forecasting. Additionally, Rubattua et al. (2023) explored feature engineering techniques, particularly for load forecasting, emphasizing the importance of lagged variables and rolling features to capture time-dependent patterns in energy consumption. Their research showed how such features could be used to improve model performance, especially for energy consumption predictions. Ibrahim et al. (2022) examined the impact of lagged features on short-term load forecasting in smart grids, highlighting the role of time-based features in capturing seasonal and daily demand variations.

These studies significantly contribute to the broader understanding of how temporal features such as lagged values and rolling averages can improve forecasting accuracy. However, these approaches largely focus on aggregated data and do not fully account for the granular, appliance-level details, which are essential for residential energy forecasting. For example, Schaffer et al. (2022) work with hourly energy consumption data but do not specifically address how to reconcile these values with cumulative data over different timescales. Similarly, Rubattua et al. (2023) emphasize the role of lagged variables but lack a more refined approach for handling appliance-specific consumption patterns, which could be crucial in enhancing accuracy at the appliance level.

Our study extends these aggregation techniques by ensuring that hourly totals are reconciled with cumulative energy values using a 5% deviation threshold. Additionally, we create and validate temporal features such as hour-of-day, day-of-week, and holiday indicators to capture cyclical patterns in appliance energy use. These features enable our model to better account for daily and seasonal variations in energy consumption, addressing gaps in the aforementioned studies. By focusing on appliance-level data, we enhance the ability of the model to understand micro-level consumption trends, thus improving the forecasting accuracy and enabling more precise predictions for residential energy use.

### **2.2.4 Final Dataset Assembly and Weather Data Integration** {#2.2.4-final-dataset-assembly-and-weather-data-integration}

Forecasting accuracy in energy consumption modeling can be significantly improved by effectively integrating exogenous variables such as weather data into the energy forecasting process. Studies in energy forecasting (Mystakidis et al., 2024\) highlight the importance of preprocessing and evaluation metrics to enhance the accuracy of forecasting models, particularly when integrating multiple data sources. Mystakidis et al. (2024) emphasize how integrating weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, with energy consumption data helps improve the reliability of forecasts, particularly in systems where energy demand is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Neumann et al. (2023) similarly discuss how the synchronization of weather data with energy time series improves the overall forecasting accuracy by addressing the challenges of temporal consistency and data integration.

In addition, Rubattua et al. (2023) provide insights into the importance of creating additional features that account for both temporal and environmental factors in load forecasting. They highlight the value of integrating weather-related variables, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, to capture the influence of environmental changes on energy demand. This aligns with our approach of integrating these weather variables into energy forecasting models, particularly for appliance-level forecasting, which is more sensitive to localized weather patterns.  
	  
However, these studies often focus on broader energy systems or aggregated data, leaving a gap in the application of weather data integration at the appliance level. For example, while Mystakidis et al. (2024) and Neumann et al. (2023) explore weather integration in energy forecasting, their focus is primarily on aggregate demand, and they do not address the specific challenges of integrating high-resolution appliance-level data with real-time weather information. Additionally, Rubattua et al. (2023) discuss the use of environmental variables in load forecasting but do not emphasize the importance of synchronizing weather data with individual appliance energy readings at high temporal resolutions, such as 10-minute intervals.

To bridge these gaps, our study integrates real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, incorporating temperature, humidity, and rainfall as exogenous variables alongside appliance energy data. We ensure synchronization between the weather and appliance-level energy consumption readings, using rigorous temporal consistency checks and physical plausibility validations to ensure high-quality data for forecasting. Furthermore, we apply a 5% deviation threshold for the reconciliation of hourly energy totals with cumulative energy values, ensuring the integrity of our dataset. This approach enhances the robustness of appliance-level forecasting models, addressing the limitations of previous studies that typically focus on larger-scale or aggregate data without the fine-grained synchronization and validation needed for residential energy forecasting.

## **2.3 Synthetic Data Generation Using GANs and Time-Series Generators** {#2.3-synthetic-data-generation-using-gans-and-time-series-generators}

	This section reviews key works on GAN-based synthetic time-series generation and their extensions to energy consumption data. The first subsection discusses general-purpose time-series GAN architectures, including TimeGAN and its improvements and transfer-based variants designed for small-sample settings. Meanwhile, the second subsection focuses on GAN applications in energy data reconstruction, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and the gaps that motivate this study’s TimeGAN-based, Meralco-constrained household reconstruction pipeline.

### **2.3.1 Synthetic Data Generation Using GANs** {#2.3.1-synthetic-data-generation-using-gans}

	A more recent contribution to GAN-based time-series generation is the work of Zhang et al. (2025), who applied a TimeGAN-driven augmentation framework to building electricity load data characterized by strong workday–holiday imbalances. Their approach integrates TimeGAN with K-means clustering, sliding-window segmentation, and a CNN–LSTM forecasting model optimized using a genetic algorithm. The study demonstrated that locally targeted augmentation substantially improves holiday prediction accuracy, increases R², and reduces NRMSE and NMAE. Although their work focuses on building-level loads, it highlights how TimeGAN can effectively address sample imbalance, preserve temporal behavior, and enhance downstream predictive performance—principles that are relevant to reconstructing missing residential energy data.

Building on similar foundations, Tang et al. (2025) proposed an Improved TimeGAN for augmenting industrial energy consumption time-series. Their model enhances the original TimeGAN by incorporating a multi-head self-attention mechanism within the recovery module, enabling better long-range dependency modeling, particularly valuable under limited data availability. After preprocessing through outlier removal and min–max normalization, the authors evaluated synthetic data quality using statistical similarity metrics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis) and dimensionality reduction tools such as PCA and t-SNE. The Improved TimeGAN achieved average differences below 0.5% for means and quartiles, variance errors below 10%, and improved RMSE, MAE, and R² in subsequent forecasting tasks. However, the method remains limited to single-source industrial equipment data and does not incorporate household-specific constraints such as monthly billing totals or multi-appliance behavior.

In a different domain, Chen et al. (2024) introduced DLT-GAN, a dual-layer transfer GAN designed for small-sample speech time-series. The architecture consists of a Coarse Transfer Network and a Fine Transfer Network, enabling the reuse of learned representations and reducing irrelevant noise when transferring features across related tasks. DLT-GAN demonstrated improved convergence, enhanced realism, and better timbre consistency in small-sample speech datasets. Although not energy-focused, this work directly addresses challenges associated with limited sample availability, a situation similar to having only two months of real smart-plug data in the present study. Still, DLT-GAN does not incorporate concepts unique to the energy domain, such as kWh scaling, tariff alignment, or appliance-level decomposition.

Taken together, these GAN-based time-series generators show that temporal structure can be preserved through architectures such as TimeGAN, which couple embedding networks, supervised step-ahead prediction, and adversarial learning. Studies such as Tang et al. (2025) demonstrate that architectural enhancements like multi-head self-attention improve reconstruction quality and long-range dependency modeling, while works like Chen et al. (2024) highlight how transfer-based GAN designs can strengthen robustness under small-sample conditions. These findings establish a solid foundation for applying advanced GAN frameworks to realistic synthetic time-series generation.

However, none of these works directly address the challenges of residential energy reconstruction under the constraints of incomplete yearly smart-plug data, known monthly kWh totals from utility bills, and the need for per-appliance synthetic profiles aligned with household billing. To address these gaps, the present study adapts an Improved-TimeGAN-style architecture to the household electricity domain. The model is trained on two months of daily household load curves and then used to generate synthetic daily sequences for the missing months. Unlike the original TimeGAN and DLT-GAN implementations, the synthetic sequences in this study are subsequently scaled to match Meralco monthly energy consumption and decomposed into appliance-level profiles using real appliance shares. This ensures that the generated data remain physically consistent, seasonally aligned, and economically accurate with respect to actual household billing.

### **2.3.2 GANs in Energy Data Reconstruction and Their Limitations** {#2.3.2-gans-in-energy-data-reconstruction-and-their-limitations}

Asre and Anwar (2022) proposed a Time-Variant GAN for synthetic energy data generation using electricity consumption data from AEMO across five Australian states (VIC, NSW, QLD, SA, TAS) at 30-minute intervals. Their architecture includes generator, discriminator, embedding, and recovery components, and uses min–max normalization followed by PCA and t-SNE to compare real and synthetic distributions. They evaluate performance using “train on synthetic, test on real” (TSTR) strategies and show that the synthetic state-level load retains similar statistics (mean, standard deviation, interquartile range) and temporal behavior, while also supporting privacy-preserving modeling. However, their focus is on aggregated state-level energy rather than household or appliance-level data. The model does not incorporate monthly billing information, nor does it decompose total load into appliance segments. Training is also relatively complex and not designed to handle very short monitoring windows, which is a key constraint in the present study.

Yilmaz and Korn (2022) investigated multiple GAN architectures, RCGAN, TimeGAN, CWGAN, and RCWGAN, for synthetic electricity demand generation at the individual customer level using 15-minute interval residential data. They apply robust scaling and analyze distributions of mean, skewness, kurtosis, as well as autocorrelation patterns, to assess how well each GAN reproduces real consumption behavior. Their findings indicate that all four GANs can generate realistic load profiles, with CWGAN achieving the closest match in kurtosis and RCGAN producing the most stable synthetic sequences. TimeGAN performs comparatively worse in modeling low-load periods. The primary contribution is a comparative evaluation of GAN variants for one-dimensional household demand, without extending to monthly reconstruction, appliance breakdown, or integration with utility billing data.

Tang et al. (2025) (as discussed earlier) apply their enhanced TimeGAN model to manufacturing energy consumption with 15-minute sampling. They use the synthetic sequences to augment limited real data and then train a CNN–GRU forecasting model, showing improvements in RMSE, MAE, and R² when synthetic data are included. Statistical metrics (mean, variance, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis) and visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE) confirm that synthetic sequences closely match real process-level loads. While this work provides a strong precedent for using Improved TimeGAN in energy applications, it operates in a single-source industrial context, assumes continuous process operation, and does not incorporate constraints such as monthly billing totals or appliance heterogeneity, which are central to residential use cases.

Kaselimi et al. (2022) offer an extensive review of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques, which aim to disaggregate aggregate household load into appliance-level signals using advanced deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, sequence-to-sequence architectures, and GAN-based NILM formulations. Their survey emphasizes challenges such as noisy measurements, imbalanced datasets, generalization across households, privacy, and the need for explainable and trustworthy models. While GANs are highlighted as a promising component of NILM pipelines, these approaches depend heavily on high-frequency or richly labeled data and focus on disaggregation rather than reconstructing missing months of historical consumption. NILM techniques also tend not to enforce consistency with monthly billing data, and they are not designed to synthesize entirely missing seasons from short observation windows.

Across these studies, several common limitations emerge when evaluated in the context of the current research problem. Many GAN-based energy works operate at the aggregated level, such as state-level grids or industrial process data, rather than focusing on household- or appliance-level signals, limiting their applicability to fine-grained residential forecasting. Existing methods also rarely incorporate external energy constraints such as monthly kWh totals from utility bills, meaning that synthetic outputs may resemble real load shapes statistically but are not constrained to match actual billed consumption. Most prior approaches generate only a single total load profile and do not perform appliance-level reconstruction aligned with measured smart-plug data or appliance energy shares. Furthermore, although several works address limited-data settings, they do not directly tackle the specific challenge of having only two months of real household measurements while requiring a complete 12-month dataset for seasonal forecasting. Finally, the majority of GAN applications are designed for data augmentation rather than historical reconstruction, and therefore do not enforce consistency with both real smart-plug readings and utility billing records when generating missing months of consumption data.

The present study addresses these gaps by adapting an Improved TimeGAN-style architecture to a residential household context and embedding it into a constrained reconstruction pipeline. First, two months of 10-minute appliance-level smart plug data are preprocessed and segmented into daily sequences for TimeGAN training. Second, the trained generator is used to produce synthetic daily load profiles for all missing days in the year. Third, for each month without full smart-plug coverage, the synthetic daily profiles are scaled so that their aggregate kWh exactly matches the corresponding Meralco bill, enforcing an energy constraint that prior works do not implement. Finally, using appliance energy shares derived from the two months of real data, the scaled household load is decomposed into appliance-level synthetic profiles, providing a 12-month high-resolution dataset suitable for SARIMAX forecasting and cost estimation.

By combining GAN-based time-series generation with utility-bill scaling and appliance-level reconstruction, this study extends the existing literature in a direction that is directly aligned with practical household energy management. Rather than relying on NILM or large-scale industrial datasets, the proposed approach leverages a short window of real smart-plug measurements and publicly available billing information to reconstruct a complete, appliance-resolved, 10-minute dataset that would otherwise be unavailable.

## **2.4 Forecasting Model Design and Validation for Appliance-Level Energy Consumption** {#2.4-forecasting-model-design-and-validation-for-appliance-level-energy-consumption}

This section presents the full forecasting pipeline for hourly appliance-level electricity consumption. The approach integrates statistical pre-modeling checks, adaptive SARIMAX model fitting with exogenous variables, and rigorous evaluation procedures. Prior studies inform individual components of this pipeline, but none combine them at the hourly appliance level with adaptive seasonal tuning, rolling-origin forecasting, and diagnostic visual analytics for interpretation.

### **2.4.1 Pre-Modeling Checks & Stationarity** {#2.4.1-pre-modeling-checks-&-stationarity}

Accurate appliance-level forecasting begins with preparing each appliance’s time series and validating its statistical properties before modeling. Several studies have emphasized the importance of testing for stationarity, identifying seasonality, and stabilizing load patterns prior to forecasting. For example, Shadkam (2020) used the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test to assess stationarity and applied SARIMAX with exogenous variables such as temperature and humidity to forecast building-level energy demand. This supports our use of ADF to evaluate whether an appliance’s hourly energy signal is stationary, and to apply differencing (including seasonal differencing) if it is not.

Muñoz et al. (2023) further demonstrated that decomposition and differencing improve model performance by reducing noise and enforcing stationarity in building-level load forecasting. This motivates our use of preprocessing (first differencing, seasonal differencing, and optional decomposition) to stabilize highly intermittent appliance loads, such as fans and refrigerators, that exhibit on/off bursts rather than smooth consumption curves.

At the same time, prior reviews such as Ma et al. (2023) argued that short-term residential load forecasting requires models that can adapt to evolving usage routines (for example, changes in occupant behavior across weekdays vs. weekends), and that fixed seasonal assumptions are often too rigid. Chen (2025) reinforced this point at the appliance level by showing that static SARIMA configurations often underperform more adaptive machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost) when forecasting hourly appliance consumption. This gap highlights the need for adaptive seasonal tuning rather than relying on a single fixed seasonal period and parameter set.

To address this, our approach not only detects repeating daily structure (like 24-hour appliance usage cycles) using autocorrelation patterns, but also systematically refines seasonal ARIMA parameters through rigorous model identification and validation procedures. We employ a comprehensive model selection process that evaluates multiple seasonal orders (P,D,Q)s based on information criteria (AIC/BIC) and forecast error metrics for each appliance. Unlike the static model selection used in Shadkam (2020), Kienhuis (2023), and Chen (2025), our seasonal parameter identification is tailored per appliance and validated through rolling-origin evaluation, allowing the model to capture changing usage routines over time (for example, fans used more at night during hotter weeks).

### **2.4.2 SARIMAX Model Fitting with Exogenous Features and Rolling Forecasting** {#2.4.2-sarimax-model-fitting-with-exogenous-features-and-rolling-forecasting}

Once the series is prepared and seasonality is characterized, forecasting is performed using a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) model. Prior work has established SARIMAX as a strong baseline for energy demand forecasting when external drivers are included. Shadkam (2020) modeled university building demand using SARIMAX with temperature and humidity as exogenous regressors and selected ARIMA/SARIMA orders with AIC. This directly informs our use of SARIMAX to model hourly appliance-level energy consumption and our use of weather and temporal context, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, hour of day, day of week, weekend/holiday flags, recent lags (lag at t−24), and rolling means, as an exogenous feature vector Xt  
	​  
Chen (2025) showed that, at the appliance level, forecast accuracy improves substantially when time-derived features (lags, rolling averages) are engineered and fed into the model rather than relying on raw consumption alone. We incorporate that insight by explicitly constructing an exogenous feature vector per timestamp that blends environmental factors (weather), behavioral/calendar features, and autoregressive structure. This preserves interpretability because each regressor in Xt has a coefficient that can be inspected, unlike in opaque machine learning models.

However, most existing studies either evaluate models with a simple train/test split (Kienhuis, 2023; Chen, 2025\) or assume a fixed training window (Shadkam, 2020). These evaluation strategies do not fully reflect how forecasting systems behave in deployment, where models must repeatedly forecast “the next day” given everything observed so far. To close this gap, we adopt a rolling-origin evaluation procedure: at each step in the testing period, the model is retrained on all data available up to time t, and then asked to predict future consumption (like the next 24 hours). This rolling approach mimics real operational forecasting rather than a one-time offline benchmark.

In addition, while prior work such as Ma (2023) stresses the need for adaptive and interpretable forecasting in homes, it does not present an implementation that jointly (1) incorporates exogenous weather and behavioral context, (2) applies systematic seasonal parameter selection for appliance-level patterns, and (3) evaluates under rolling-origin conditions at the appliance level. Our study integrates all three, producing forecasts that are both traceable (via SARIMAX coefficients) and robust to behavioral drift.

### **2.4.3 Forecast Accuracy, Diagnostic Validation, and User-Interpretable Insight** {#2.4.3-forecast-accuracy,-diagnostic-validation,-and-user-interpretable-insight}

After fitting the model, it is not sufficient to report a single accuracy score. Prior studies have relied on standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to compare forecasting models (Kienhuis, 2023; Chen, 2025). These metrics remain essential, and we also compute Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R² to quantify how much of the appliance's consumption variance is explained by the model. This multi-metric view lets us compare our SARIMAX approach against traditional baselines and machine learning alternatives.

However, numerical error alone does not confirm model reliability. Shadkam (2020) emphasized the importance of residual diagnostics, checking that the residuals behave like white noise, exhibit no remaining autocorrelation, and pass statistical goodness checks such as the Ljung–Box test. We adopt that practice by analyzing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of residuals and applying the Ljung–Box Q-test to confirm that the model has captured temporal structure. This step is critical for validating that the model is statistically well-specified, not just “good on average.”

Ma (2023) further highlights that residential forecasting must be explainable and adaptive, since household users and operators need to understand not only “how much will we consume,” but also “why did we miss here?” and “under what conditions does the model struggle?” Inspired by that need for interpretability, we extend beyond purely statistical diagnostics and generate visual diagnostics, including (1) hourly heatmaps of forecast error to reveal time-of-day patterns, (2) per-appliance residual boxplots to identify which appliances are hardest to predict, and (3) scatter plots of forecast error versus temperature to expose weather-related bias. These visual tools translate model behavior into actionable insight for users and system designers.

In contrast to prior work. which often ends at reporting MAE or RMSE on a static test split,  our evaluation loop treats validation as an ongoing process. We combine quantitative error metrics, statistical residual testing, rolling-origin realism, and appliance-level visual diagnostics. This produces a forecast model that is not only accurate but also auditable, explainable, and ready to be surfaced to end users in the context of appliance-level energy budgeting and cost control.

## **2.5 System Implementation and Validation for Appliance-Level Energy Forecasting and Cost Estimation** {#2.5-system-implementation-and-validation-for-appliance-level-energy-forecasting-and-cost-estimation}

This section covers the implementation and validation of a system designed for appliance-level energy forecasting and cost estimation. By integrating IoT devices, real-time data, and forecasting models, our study develops a framework that provides accurate energy consumption and cost predictions. The system is tailored to the Philippine context, ensuring effective energy management and cost control for residential users.

### **2.5.1 Cost Estimation Methodology** {#2.5.1-cost-estimation-methodology}

Forecasting accuracy in energy consumption modeling can be significantly enhanced by integrating cost estimation methodologies at the appliance level. Many previous studies have explored energy consumption forecasting but often overlook providing a detailed framework for cost estimation. For instance, Erru Torculas et al. (2023) employ machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption but do not include any cost estimation model or break down the costs at the appliance level. Their focus on forecasting energy consumption patterns fails to translate these predictions into actionable cost predictions, thereby leaving a gap in managing energy costs effectively. Similarly, Jelly Grace A. Caw-it et al. (2025) apply ARIMA to forecast monthly electricity expenses but do not provide appliance-level forecasts or cost breakdowns. Their study is limited to household-level consumption predictions, which makes it less useful for understanding how each appliance contributes to overall energy costs.

In a similar vein, Oscar Bryan M. Magtibay et al. (2021) focus on energy consumption monitoring using IoT devices. Although their work tracks energy use, they do not provide any detailed cost estimation methods or appliance-level energy cost analysis. This is a significant limitation in practical applications, as understanding the financial impact of energy consumption is critical for consumers and utility companies. Additionally, Mitesh Singh et al. (2021) present an energy monitoring system with data visualization, but they omit any discussion on cost estimation. This is a common gap, as it is essential for users to understand the financial implications of their energy consumption to optimize their energy use.

The studies reviewed primarily focus on forecasting energy consumption or monitoring energy use but lack detailed cost estimation methodologies that are crucial for understanding energy expenses at the appliance level. Unlike these studies, our approach integrates energy consumption forecasting with appliance-specific cost estimation. Moreover, our study incorporates cost translation models that account for time-of-use tariffs, which many previous studies fail to address. This allows our study to provide energy costs for each appliance and identify the top-consuming appliances that contribute most to overall household energy expenses. By providing this level of detail, our study offers actionable insights for consumers, helping them optimize their energy consumption and manage costs effectively, something that has been overlooked in prior research.

### **2.5.2  Budget Threshold and Alert Engine** {#2.5.2-budget-threshold-and-alert-engine}

Effective management of energy costs can be significantly enhanced by integrating budget thresholds and alert mechanisms for energy consumption and cost at the appliance level. Many studies have explored energy management and optimization strategies, but few have integrated real-time budget monitoring with alert systems for appliance-level cost forecasting. For example, Shaban et al. (2025) discuss optimizing appliance scheduling under varying tariff systems to reduce energy costs. However, their study lacks a real-time alerting mechanism that notifies users when their energy consumption approaches a predefined budget threshold. While their focus is on scheduling strategies, it does not incorporate dynamic monitoring and alerting features necessary for proactive cost management. Similarly, Eirinaki et al. (2022) focus on real-time energy-saving recommendations for appliance usage but do not include any system for managing energy budgets or alerting users when budget thresholds are reached. Their study’s recommendations can help reduce energy consumption but fail to address the practical challenge of budget control, which is essential for users managing energy costs effectively.

Zhao et al. (2025) in their study on residential energy consumption and price forecasting, look at energy scheduling and price forecasting but do not integrate real-time alerts or appliance-level cost forecasting. The lack of real-time alerts in their system is a significant limitation for consumers who need to manage energy costs effectively on a daily basis, particularly as their study does not focus on providing detailed budget control mechanisms.

Assadian & Assadian (2023) present a data-driven model for predicting energy consumption at the appliance level, but similarly, they omit any budget management or alert systems. While their model offers valuable insights into energy usage predictions, it does not address the critical issue of providing users with alerts when their energy costs are about to exceed a set budget, which would allow them to take action to reduce consumption before costs spiral.

These studies, while offering valuable energy consumption forecasting techniques and energy-saving strategies, overlook the need for systems that combine budget threshold management with real-time alerts. The absence of dynamic alerts when users are approaching or exceeding their budget limits presents a significant gap in real-time energy cost management. Additionally, most studies focus on aggregate-level data or generic recommendations without the finer appliance-level breakdown required for effective cost control.

To address these gaps, our study integrates real-time budget management and alert mechanisms, offering a system that allows users to set budget thresholds for energy consumption and cost. When thresholds are close to being exceeded, the system triggers alerts to notify the user, providing them with the opportunity to adjust their usage. Furthermore, we incorporate detailed cost estimation models that account for time-of-use tariffs, which many previous studies fail to address. By offering these features, our system not only enhances the ability to manage energy budgets but also provides actionable insights for consumers to optimize their energy consumption and control costs effectively. This integrated approach addresses shortcomings in previous studies, which generally overlook the combined functionality of budget control and real-time alerting at the appliance level.

### **2.5.3  System Artifacts and Validation** {#2.5.3-system-artifacts-and-validation}

Several studies have explored energy consumption forecasting and monitoring, but many have overlooked integrating user-facing features, such as dashboards and alert systems, which are essential for effective energy management. For example, Erru Torculas et al. (2023) developed a machine learning-based system for energy consumption forecasting but did not include any user interface artifacts, such as dashboards, which are essential for enabling users to visualize and interact with the data effectively. This lack of user-facing features makes it difficult for users to take full advantage of the system and manage their energy consumption effectively.

Similarly, Oscar Bryan M. Magtibay et al. (2021) proposed an IoT-based energy monitoring system for the Mabini Building in De La Salle Lipa but did not include a user-friendly dashboard or cost estimation features. Although the system focuses on energy monitoring, the absence of cost breakdowns and interactive interfaces limits its usability for consumers who need actionable insights into their energy expenses.

In another example, Mitesh Singh et al. (2021) discussed an energy consumption monitoring and control system using data visualization and IoT, but their system lacks a user-friendly dashboard that would allow users to manage energy usage effectively and see how individual appliances contribute to total energy costs. While they provide visualization of energy data, the lack of context, such as cost estimation or budget management features, limits the system's practical value for consumers.

The studies reviewed mainly focus on energy consumption forecasting or monitoring but fail to provide comprehensive user-facing artifacts that allow for interactive engagement with the system. Unlike these studies, our system integrates a web dashboard that offers a clear and accessible visualization of energy consumption, cost breakdowns, and alerts for proactive energy management. This dashboard is designed to enhance user interaction with the system and provide actionable insights into their energy consumption patterns. Furthermore, by incorporating mobile alerts, users are notified when they are nearing budget thresholds or exceeding their set limits, empowering them to make real-time decisions to optimize their energy use.

In addition to user-facing features, validating the accuracy of the energy consumption forecasts and cost estimates is crucial for ensuring the system's reliability and precision. Many previous studies have developed forecasting models without providing detailed validation procedures, leaving uncertainties regarding the accuracy of their predictions. For instance, Erru Torculas et al. (2023) focus on energy forecasting using machine learning algorithms, but they do not include a formal validation process to assess the accuracy of their forecasts, which may undermine the system’s reliability.

Similarly, Jelly Grace A. Caw-it et al. (2025) apply the ARIMA model to forecast monthly electricity expenses but do not include any validation framework to assess the performance of their model, leaving their forecasting results uncertain. Mitesh Singh et al. (2021) describe an energy monitoring and control system without a detailed validation process, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of their system.

In contrast, our study incorporates a comprehensive validation framework that assesses the accuracy of both energy consumption forecasts and cost estimates. By validating the forecasting models with real-world data and using methods such as cross-validation and error metrics, we ensure the precision of our predictions. This rigorous validation process confirms the reliability of the system, providing users with confidence in the accuracy of the forecasts and cost estimates generated. Our approach to system artifacts and validation addresses the gaps identified in previous studies, ensuring not only a user-friendly interface but also reliable, accurate energy management and cost estimation.

## **2.6 Synthesis** {#2.6-synthesis}

	Our methodology builds directly on prior studies in IoT energy monitoring, preprocessing, forecasting, and cost-oriented decision support, but we extend them into a single end-to-end system that works at the appliance level, on an hourly horizon, under Philippine household conditions. First, studies by Condon (2023) and Ahmed (2022) demonstrated that low-cost smart plugs like the Sonoff POW R2 can be deployed to capture real-time appliance-level energy data and stream it to cloud services for analysis, proving that continuous monitoring is technically feasible at the device level. These works, along with findings from Santos (2023), Hernandez (2020), Petralia (2023), and Athanasoulias (2024), also explored practical issues such as sensor accuracy and sampling frequency, with results suggesting that very high-frequency logging (e.g., every 10 seconds) improves detail but increases storage and network load, while 5–10 minute sampling can still capture meaningful appliance behavior. Meanwhile, other studies in energy and demand forecasting (Santos, 2021; Ampountolas, 2021; Liu, 2023; Aguirre-Fraire, 2024\) showed that using external variables like temperature, humidity, and electricity prices as exogenous features improves prediction quality, although these works mostly operated at the building or household aggregate level and did not translate appliance-level usage into consumer-facing cost. Building on these foundations, our system adopts readily available Tuya-based smart plugs (SMATRUL 16A sockets), but instead of assuming their readings are always correct, we enforce a Physics Consistency and Scaling Verification step that recomputes power from voltage, current, and power factor and compares it against the plug’s own reported wattage using a strict ±5% tolerance rule. We also run a continuous Python-based logger on an Azure VM that polls Tuya’s cloud API every 10 minutes, stores all readings per appliance in CSV, and interpolates brief outages to prevent timeline gaps. This logging cadence matches what the literature identifies as an effective compromise between resolution and long-term feasibility, and we later aggregate that cleaned 10-minute data to hourly values, which aligns with our 24-hour forecast horizon. Finally, unlike previous work, we enrich every appliance’s series with aligned contextual variables, localized temperature, humidity, and rainfall from OpenWeatherMap, calendar information (time-of-day, day-of-week, weekend/holiday), and the current Meralco residential tariff (₱/kWh), so that each appliance’s consumption can be related not only to behavior and weather, but also to cost in pesos for Filipino households.

The next methodological layer addresses preprocessing and data cleaning, which prior studies identified as critical but did not fully specify for noisy commodity IoT data. Chen (2025), Eirinaki (2022), and Mystakidis (2024) emphasized that forecasting models like SARIMAX and LSTM depend heavily on consistent timestamps, correct units, and well-structured historical logs. Dhaou (2023) warned that smart plug outputs can become physically inconsistent if scaling factors for voltage, current, or power factor drift. Other work, such as Ünal (2021) and Arvanitidis & Bargiotas (2022), focused on interval validation, outlier removal, and interpolation, while Weber (2021) and Schaffer (2022) tackled the challenges of missing intervals and converting cumulative energy counters into usable per-interval energy values. However, most of these studies dealt with household- or building-level meters sampled every 15 to 60 minutes, and did not fully address the messy realities of appliance-level data at 10-minute resolution: counter resets, Wi-Fi/API gaps, and partial logging. Our methodology takes those ideas and turns them into a strict, auditable preprocessing pipeline for each appliance. We begin by enforcing schema and timestamp conformance at the source: every incoming record from the smart plug is aligned to a 10-minute cadence in UTC+8, and every weather reading is aligned to an hourly cadence, which we then merge later. We perform Physics Consistency and Scaling Verification, where we recompute true power from voltage × current × power factor and verify that the plug-reported wattage is physically plausible and within tolerance; if not, we correct it. We then derive per-interval energy in two independent ways: (1) from changes in the device’s cumulative kWh register and (2) from average power over the interval multiplied by elapsed time. We compare both, accept whichever value is within a ±10% decision window, and fall back to the physics-derived estimate if the cumulative register is reset or glitched. Short gaps (≤20 minutes) are interpolated in terms of voltage/current/power and then re-derived; larger gaps are explicitly marked as missing instead of “guessed” to avoid hallucinating consumption. Sudden negative jumps in cumulative energy indicate counter resets, which are automatically detected and corrected. We also run daily reconciliation: after cleaning all 10-minute intervals, we sum them and compare against the day’s reported cumulative change to ensure the total energy for that appliance is still physically consistent, reprocessing if the deviation exceeds 5%. Only then do we aggregate to hourly kWh and attach engineered features such as hour-of-day, weekday/weekend flags, holiday indicators, lag values (e.g., previous day at the same hour, previous week at the same hour), 24-hour and 168-hour rolling means, and synchronized weather variables at that hour. This end-to-end procedure operationalizes what previous authors recommended in parts, validation, interpolation, outlier control, cumulative-to-interval conversion, weather alignment, but applies it specifically at the appliance level with explicit numeric tolerance rules and auditability.

We next integrate insights from recent advances in GAN-based synthetic time-series generation to address a unique constraint that no prior study addressed: the requirement to reconstruct an entire year of appliance-level data from only two months of real measurements. Recent works show that GANs can preserve temporal structure and generate realistic synthetic loads even under imbalance or limited data. Zhang et al. (2025) demonstrated that a TimeGAN-based augmentation pipeline with K-means clustering and a CNN–LSTM predictor improves forecasting for imbalanced building loads (e.g., holidays vs. workdays), while Tang et al. (2025) showed that an Improved TimeGAN with multi-head attention can generate energy sequences with \<0.5% mean and quartile error and enhance downstream forecast accuracy in industrial settings. Similarly, Chen et al. (2024) improved small-sample generation using a Dual-Layer Transfer GAN, and studies by Asre & Anwar (2022) and Yilmaz & Korn (2022) confirmed that GANs can replicate temporal statistics of aggregated or household-level energy data. However, these works did not incorporate household billing constraints, did not operate at the appliance level, and did not address reconstructing long missing periods from short monitoring windows. Building on the core strengths identified in these studies, temporal preservation, imbalance handling, small-sample robustness, and statistical fidelity, our methodology adapts an Improved-TimeGAN-style approach to household data. We train the generator using two months of real daily household load curves, then synthesize daily sequences for the missing months. Unlike previous GAN works, we scale each month’s synthetic load to exactly match the household’s Meralco bill and then decompose the scaled load into appliance-level profiles using real appliance energy shares. This produces a physically consistent, seasonally aligned, and economically accurate 12-month appliance-level dataset suitable for SARIMAX forecasting and cost estimation, something not achieved in any prior GAN-based literature.

From there, our forecasting methodology builds on statistical and adaptive modeling strategies found in previous work, but extends them to handle hourly appliance-level demand in a way that is both explainable and deployable. Earlier forecasting studies such as Shadkam (2020), Muñoz (2023), and Kienhuis (2023) showed that Seasonal ARIMA/SARIMAX with exogenous variables, combined with pre-model tests like the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity, can accurately forecast building-level or campus-level load. These works also used differencing and seasonal differencing to stabilize non-stationary series before fitting the model. At the same time, residential forecasting literature (Ma, 2023\) and appliance-level forecasting work (Chen, 2025\) stressed two problems: (1) occupant behavior shifts over time, and (2) static SARIMA configurations underperform when patterns drift. Drawing from these findings, our methodology applies ADF-based differencing, autocorrelation analysis for seasonal detection, and appliance-specific model identification rather than a one-size-fits-all seasonal structure. We evaluate multiple seasonal orders and determine the best configuration using information criteria and forecast error metrics, then validate each appliance’s model using rolling-origin evaluation, which mirrors real deployment more closely than the static train/test splits used in earlier studies.

Finally, our validation strategy draws from both statistical diagnostics and interpretability requirements identified in previous literature. Shadkam (2020) emphasized residual diagnostics (ACF, PACF, Ljung–Box), while Ma (2023) highlighted the need for interpretable diagnostics that help identify where and why forecasts fail. Inspired by these findings, we use MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² alongside residual whiteness tests, and generate visual diagnostics including forecast-error heatmaps, per-appliance residual boxplots, and error-temperature relationships. This creates a validation loop that is not only statistically rigorous but also operationally transparent.

## **2.7 Theoretical Framework** {#2.7-theoretical-framework}

	This section presents the theoretical foundation that underpins the framework adopted in this study. It outlines the Modified Box-Jenkins Methodology proposed by Arash Shadkam (2020), a structured and iterative approach to developing, training, and validating time-series forecasting models. The framework, specifically tailored to energy consumption forecasting, integrates both traditional and extended elements to ensure a comprehensive approach to data processing, model development, and evaluation.

![][image1]  
*Figure 2.1. Modified Box-Jenkins methodology*

The Modified Box-Jenkins Methodology, which is an extension of the classical Box-Jenkins approach for time-series forecasting, provides the analytical foundation for this thesis, offering a structured and iterative approach for developing, training, and validating time-series models. In this study, the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) model is used to forecast energy consumption. The traditional Box-Jenkins methodology is typically divided into three primary stages: Identification, Estimation, and Diagnostic Checking. In this research, we extend this framework by incorporating two additional critical steps: Data Collection and Preprocessing at the start and Performance Evaluation at the end. This modification creates a robust, five-stage process that is highly applicable to real-world smart energy systems, ensuring that the data is properly handled and evaluated before forecasting takes place.

The Conceptual Framework serves as the system architecture that directly implements the theoretical Modified Box-Jenkins workflow, ensuring a smooth and logical flow from raw data to actionable user insights. The process begins with Data Collection, where essential inputs such as Appliance Metadata, Smart Plug Data, Weather Data, and Tariff Data are gathered. This raw data then moves into the next stage, Data Preprocessing & Preparation, where it undergoes cleaning, validation, and transformation. This aligns with the theoretical step of Preprocessing in the Box-Jenkins methodology, where data is processed and prepared for time-series modeling. This preparation is crucial to ensure the dataset is suitable for the subsequent model training.

In the core of the analytical process lies the Forecasting Model, which executes the key stages of the traditional Box-Jenkins methodology. It starts with Pre-modeling Checks, corresponding to the Identification step, where the appropriate SARIMAX model structure is determined based on the characteristics of the data. This is followed by Estimation, where the optimal parameters (such as p, d, q, P, D, Q) are identified through a grid search process, using criteria like the AIC score. Next, Diagnostics are performed to evaluate the model’s residuals and ensure its statistical robustness, which mirrors the Diagnostic Checking step in Box-Jenkins. Once the model is validated, it moves into the Forecasting phase, where energy consumption predictions are generated.

Following forecasting, the system enters the Performance Evaluation phase, where the forecasted consumption values are combined with Tariff Data to perform Cost Estimation. This estimated cost is then monitored by the Budget Threshold & Alert Engine, which ensures the practical value of the forecast by providing alerts if the predicted costs exceed the set budget. Finally, the results are communicated to the user through the Web Dashboard & Visualization and Mobile Notifications, delivering both analytical insights and actionable information.

## **2.8 Conceptual Framework** {#2.8-conceptual-framework}

To provide a clear overview of the study’s methodological flow, Figure 2.2 presents the conceptual framework of this study, which adopts the Input–Process–Output (IPO) model. It traces the flow from inputs through processing to outputs, describing how the system forecasts appliance-level electricity consumption, estimates cost, and delivers user visualizations and notifications.

![][image2]  
*Figure 2.2. Conceptual Framework of the Appliance-Level Electricity Consumption Forecasting and Cost Estimation System*

The conceptual framework for this study begins with four key inputs: smart plug data, weather data, appliance metadata, and tariff information. Among these, the smart plug data, weather data, and appliance metadata form the primary sources feeding into the data preparation workflow. Smart plug data provides high-resolution appliance-level electricity measurements, weather data captures external environmental conditions that influence consumption, and appliance metadata supplies descriptive information such as appliance type, wattage, and location. Tariff data, meanwhile, is reserved for the system’s cost estimation stage.

These inputs first enter the Data Preprocessing and Preparation phase, where raw measurements are transformed into a clean, consistent, time-aligned dataset suitable for modeling. This phase begins with data integrity verification and standardization, ensuring that all input files follow the required schema and that units such as volts, watts, and timestamps are properly aligned. The system then proceeds to data cleaning and energy derivation, applying physics-based checks, tolerance rules, fallback estimation, and cumulative-energy validation to produce accurate 10-minute interval energy readings. Because the forecasting model operates on an hourly timescale, the validated 10-minute intervals are aggregated into hourly energy totals and paired with their corresponding hourly weather observations. Additional features, such as lagged consumption, rolling averages, and time-based indicators, are created during feature construction. Finally, the data undergoes final transformation, producing a modeling-ready dataset representing two months of real historical measurements.

To extend this limited real dataset into a full historical window, the processed real data is passed to the Synthetic Data Generation Using TimeGAN module. Using the Improved TimeGAN architecture discussed in Section 3.5, the system learns daily consumption patterns from the real data and reconstructs an additional twelve months of realistic 10-minute appliance-level profiles. These synthetic months are then denormalized, scaled to match Meralco billing totals, and decomposed into appliance-level components, yielding a complete 14-month, high-resolution dataset. This expanded dataset is then looped back into the preprocessing pipeline, where it is aligned and synchronized with the real data to ensure full compatibility with the forecasting model.

Once consolidated, the 14-month dataset enters the Forecasting Model stage. This stage begins with pre-modeling checks, such as stationarity testing, seasonality detection, and initial SARIMAX identification. The SARIMAX forecasting model is then trained using the merged real-and-synthetic dataset, allowing it to capture both daily and long-term seasonal patterns. After training, the model generates 24-hour ahead appliance-level energy forecasts, incorporating exogenous factors such as weather, day type, and temporal features. Model performance is rigorously assessed using error metrics and rolling-origin validation to ensure that predictions remain reliable and consistent.

The resulting forecasts flow into the Cost Estimation module. Here, the predicted energy consumption is combined with tariff data to compute estimated electricity costs. This cost information is also passed to the Budget Threshold and Alert Engine, where users can configure consumption or cost limits. When forecasts indicate that a user’s usage or cost is likely to exceed their set threshold, the system automatically triggers alerts.

Finally, the system produces two core outputs. First, a web dashboard and visualization interface presents users with detailed insights on real consumption, synthetic trends, forecasts, and projected costs. Second, a mobile notification system sends real-time alerts and summary updates directly to the user’s device. Together, these outputs ensure that the user is continuously informed and can make proactive decisions based on both actual and forecasted energy behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

# **CHAPTER 3** {#chapter-3}

**METHODOLOGY**

This chapter presents the methods and procedures to be undertaken in conducting the study. It outlines the research design, data collection, and data processing methods that will be applied in developing the appliance-level electricity consumption forecasting and cost estimation system. It further describes the proposed modeling approach, system implementation plan, and validation procedures intended to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the prototype system.

## **3.1 Research Design** {#3.1-research-design}

This section explains the overall research design and methodological flow adopted in the study. It outlines the type of research conducted, the logical approach used to achieve the study’s objectives, the respondents who will participate, and the implementation of the preliminary household survey that guides appliance selection. The study will employ a Quantitative Applied-Developmental Research Design with Descriptive and Predictive Components. Each component of this design plays a distinct role in the conduct of the research. 

### **3.1.1 Research Approach** {#3.1.1-research-approach}

Building upon the adopted research design, the study follows a structured methodological approach that connects descriptive analysis, predictive modeling, and applied system development into a single continuous process.

The quantitative aspect lies in the collection and analysis of numerical data from smart sockets and weather APIs. The entire process, from energy measurement to statistical forecasting, relies on numerical computations and objective accuracy metrics. The descriptive component focuses on examining household energy use behavior before forecasting. It identifies appliances that contribute most to overall consumption, determines periods of peak demand, and observes how exogenous patterns influence usage.

The predictive component is embodied in the modeling phase, where a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) model is developed to forecast appliance-level electricity consumption up to twenty-four hours ahead. Meanwhile, the applied-developmental nature of the study is reflected in the design and implementation of a working system prototype that integrates data collection, preprocessing, forecasting, cost estimation, and alert functions, transforming research outputs into a practical tool for real-world energy awareness and management.

Although the study collects data from a selected participating household, its primary focus is not to generalize specific consumption behaviors but to validate a methodological framework for appliance-level electricity forecasting. It aims to demonstrate that combining household-level energy data with exogenous variables under the SARIMAX algorithm significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to models without such features. Thus, while the implementation is household-specific, the proposed process remains replicable and adaptable across other residential settings with similar data availability.

### **3.1.2 Research Respondents** {#3.1.2-research-respondents}

The respondents of the study consist of a residential household located in Parañaque, Metro Manila, selected through convenience sampling and operating under standard Meralco residential tariff conditions. The participating household is excluded from the Peak/Off-Peak (POP) and Time-of-Use (TOU) programs to ensure that the recorded consumption reflects normal usage behavior unaffected by time-based pricing schemes. The selected household serves as a suitable implementation site for appliance-level energy monitoring, forecasting, and system validation under realistic residential conditions.

#### **A. Sampling Technique** {#a.-sampling-technique}

	The study utilizes Convenience Sampling, a non-probability sampling method in which respondents are selected based on accessibility, availability, and their ability to meet the technical and operational requirements of the study. This sampling approach is appropriate for applied developmental research that involves short-term, high-resolution appliance-level monitoring, system prototyping, and methodological validation rather than population-level inference.

	The participating household must meet the following conditions at the time of selection:

* Located in Parañaque, Metro Manila  
* Using the standard Meralco Residential Rate (R-1)  
* Not enrolled in Peak/Off-Peak (POP) or Time-of-Use (TOU) programs  
* With stable Wi-Fi connectivity to support cloud-based data logging  
* Willing to allow smart-plug installation and make appliances accessible for monitoring  
* Capable of continuous 10-minute interval data collection for a minimum of two months  
* Willing to provide access to historical Meralco electricity bills for energy scaling and validation  
* Having a safe and suitable environment for IoT device installation in compliance with electrical safety standards

	Convenience sampling is appropriate because probability-based sampling is not feasible for studies that require physical access to private residences, installation of IoT monitoring devices, and continuous short-term appliance-level data collection under controlled conditions. The study further requires stable network infrastructure, user cooperation over an extended monitoring period, and integration of external data sources such as weather and tariff information, all of which limit the practicality of random household selection.

Given these constraints, convenience sampling allows the researcher to ensure data completeness, system reliability, and participant safety, which are critical for validating the forecasting methodology and evaluating the functional performance of the proposed system prototype.

#### **B. Research Population & Sample Size** {#b.-research-population-&-sample-size}

	The broader population relevant to the study consists of residential households in Parañaque, Metro Manila, operating under the standard Meralco Residential Service Rate (R-1). According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), Parañaque recorded 182,216 households in the 2020 Census of Population and Housing.

This population context is provided to define the residential scope of the study; however, the research does not aim to draw statistical generalizations across this population.

The study employs one (1) residential household as its research respondent, with three (3) household appliances selected for continuous monitoring. The sample size is intentionally limited due to the applied and developmental nature of the research, which prioritizes methodological validation and system functionality over population-level representation.

#### **C. Methodological Rationale** {#c.-methodological-rationale}

Despite the limited number of respondents, the study does not aim to generalize consumption patterns across Parañaque, Metro Manila households. Instead, the objective is to validate an appliance-level energy forecasting methodology and integrate it into a functional monitoring and cost estimation system prototype.

The three appliances monitored within the household are selected based on responses to a preliminary household intake form. This ensures that commonly used and energy-relevant appliances are captured, allowing diverse and meaningful appliance usage profiles to be observed and ensuring that the forecasting framework is tested under realistic residential conditions.

To ensure ethical compliance, the participating household is fully informed of the study’s objectives, procedures, and scope prior to participation. Informed consent and voluntary participation are strictly observed, with the right to withdraw at any time without consequence. All collected household and personal data from the participating household are anonymized, securely stored, and handled in accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). Non-maleficence and safety are upheld through the proper handling of smart sockets and prototype equipment following established electrical safety standards. Ethical approval, permission letters, and participant consent forms are secured prior to data collection to ensure full compliance with research ethics and data protection principles.

### **3.1.3 Research Appliance Selection** {#3.1.3-research-appliance-selection}

Before data collection begins, the participating household is informed of the study’s objectives, procedures, and scope. Informed consent is obtained to ensure voluntary participation and compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). All collected household information is anonymized and treated with strict confidentiality throughout the study.

The study employs a household intake form as a preliminary data-gathering instrument. This form is completed by the participating household and serves to identify which appliances will be included in the monitoring setup. The form is concise and structured, collecting information on commonly used appliances, their usage characteristics, and their perceived importance in daily household activities.. Appliance selection follows these criteria:

1. Frequency of Use – Operated regularly or multiple times per day.  
2. Power Consumption – Contributes significantly to total household electricity usage.  
3. Predictable Usage Pattern – Exhibits consistent behavior suitable for forecasting.  
4. Operational Necessity – Essential or non-negotiable in daily household activities.  
5. Device Compatibility – Only appliances within the allowable load rating and safe operating range of the Tuya Smart Socket (discussed in Section 3.2.1) were eligible for installation. Appliances whose wattage exceeded the smart socket’s rated capacity were excluded for safety and equipment protection.

Based on the responses captured in the household intake form, the selected appliances undergo continuous monitoring. This approach ensures that the recorded data focus on energy-relevant and commonly used appliances, while complying with safety requirements and hardware compatibility constraints.

## **3.2 Data Collection Procedures** {#3.2-data-collection-procedures}

This section describes how the data required for the study are gathered and organized. Data collection begins with smart sockets recording independent appliance-level electricity consumption for each monitored device, followed by the acquisition of appliance metadata, weather data, and electricity tariff rates. These datasets form the foundation for forecasting and cost estimation. Because each smart socket tracks one appliance separately, the system produces three (3) distinct time-series datasets, one for each monitored appliance, which will later be processed and modeled individually rather than combined into a single multivariate sequence.  
![][image3]  
*Figure 3.1. Overview of the Data Collection Process*

As shown in Figure 3.1, an appliance is connected to a SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket, which transmits real-time readings to the Tuya Cloud API. A Python-based logger running on a cloud virtual machine (VM) retrieves these readings and stores them in CSV files. Appliance metadata are recorded separately as a reference file. Weather information is gathered hourly from the OpenWeatherMap API, while tariff data is independently compiled from official Meralco rate advisories. Together, these four datasets constitute the complete inputs for the study’s forecasting and cost estimation components.

### **3.2.1 Hardware and Instrumentation** {#3.2.1-hardware-and-instrumentation}

The data collection process begins with the installation of SMATRUL Tuya Smart Sockets, which serve as the main sensing instruments for appliance-level monitoring. These Wi-Fi-enabled smart plugs contain built-in energy sensors capable of recording electrical parameters such as voltage (V), current (A), and power (W), and automatically computing the total energy consumption (kWh) over time. Each selected appliance is connected to a SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket, which transmits readings at ten-minute intervals via the Tuya Cloud API Once connected to a household’s Wi-Fi network, each socket communicates directly with the Tuya Cloud API. The device transmits readings every ten minutes, ensuring regular data acquisition while remaining within the developer plan’s monthly limit. The participating household operates under a dedicated Tuya IoT Project account.

After deployment, the smart plug begins logging data automatically whenever the connected appliance is in use. The recorded readings are accessed by a Python-based logger running on a cloud virtual machine (VM) configured for continuous operation, which retrieves the data from the Tuya Cloud API and stores them in a local CSV file. The complete hardware specifications of the SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket are summarized in Table 3.1, while Figure 3.2 presents the actual device used for data collection.

| Component | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Brand | SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket (Wi-Fi, 16 A) |
| Logging Frequency | 10-minute interval (600 s) |
| Connectivity | Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz |
| Data Access | Tuya Cloud API (developer access) |
| Rated Load | 100–250 V AC, 16 A / 3000 W max |
| Operating Temperature | −20 °C to 60 °C |

*Table 3.1. SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket Specifications*  
![][image4]  
*Figure 3.2. SMATRUL Tuya Smart Socket*

	The device is designed for standard household use, equipped with built-in protection and compliant with international safety and performance standards. It carries the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) certification, which verifies that the socket’s Wi-Fi components operate safely within approved frequency ranges and without causing interference.

### **3.2.2 Data Logging Setup** {#3.2.2-data-logging-setup}

This section describes how the system continuously records and stores readings from the Tuya Cloud API using an automated, cloud-based logging process. The logging process is managed through a Python-based automation script that communicates directly with the Tuya Cloud API. Every ten (10) minutes, the script retrieves the latest readings from the three (3) active smart plugs registered under the participating household’s Tuya account. The data retrieval program runs continuously on a Cloud Virtual Machine (Microsoft Azure), provided through the first-year academic credits. The Azure environment hosts a daemon-style Python process designed for continuous, automated data logging. This process operates independently of local computers, ensuring 24/7 operation even when on-site machines are turned off. Once fetched, all readings are stored in a local CSV file. For efficient data management, each monitored appliance is assigned a dedicated CSV file that stores its individual readings. This structure allows appliance-level tracking, and aligns with the system’s objective of forecasting energy consumption per appliance.

To maintain data integrity during unexpected interruptions, a fallback estimation mechanism is implemented. When brief data gaps occur, the system uses a fallback variable to interpolate missing values based on the most recent valid readings. This method preserves dataset continuity across the monitoring timeline. 

### **3.2.3 Collected Variables** {#3.2.3-collected-variables}

After the hardware setup and data logging systems have been established, the next stage involves gathering the variables required to characterize household electricity consumption. The data collection process integrates multiple sources to capture both appliance-level and contextual factors influencing energy use. Real-time measurements from the Tuya Cloud API serve as the primary dataset, recording actual power consumption from each connected appliance. Alongside these, appliance metadata are gathered to describe device characteristics, weather data are retrieved to represent environmental conditions, and electricity tariff records are collected to provide cost references for later estimation.

As shown in Table 3.2, it  summarizes their respective sources, frequency of collection, and intended use.

| Source | Medium | Frequency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Appliance Metadata | Device Registration | Once |
| Smart Plug Readings | Tuya Cloud API | Every 10 minutes |
| Weather Data | OpenWeatherMap API | Hourly |
| Tariff Data | Meralco Official Site | Monthly |

*Table 3.2. Summary of Collected Variables*

#### **A. Appliance Metadata** {#a.-appliance-metadata}

These selected appliances are then individually registered and assigned to corresponding SMATRUL Tuya Smart Sockets for real-time monitoring. Each registered appliance is documented in an appliance metadata sheet, which links the physical device to its corresponding smart plug. This metadata serves as the reference layer that allows every energy reading to be traced back to a specific appliance and household.

The variable household\_id designates the participating household (H1), while appliance\_id follows the naming convention 1H1P, which represents the first household and first plug pairing. The internal label device\_id records the unique Tuya-assigned identifier of the smart socket used for monitoring that appliance, allowing easier cross-referencing between the Tuya device ID and its corresponding metadata. The appliance\_name specifies the type of device, and brand\_model documents the manufacturer and model name for validation purposes. The rated\_power\_watts refers to the nominal power requirement indicated on the device label, while voltage\_rating represents the operational voltage range, typically 220–240 V AC. These metadata variables describe the characteristics of each monitored appliance. 

To provide a clear overview of the metadata structure, Table 3.3 presents the list of variables used, along with their corresponding data types, formats, and descriptions

| Variable Name | Type | Format / Example | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| household\_id | Categorical | H1, H2, H3 | Identifies the participating household. |
| appliance\_id | String | 1H1P, 2H1P | Unique internal code linking a household and its monitored appliance. |
| device\_id | String | bf12abc345xyz | Tuya-assigned smart socket identifier used for API mapping. |
| appliance\_name | String | Electric Fan, Rice Cooker | Appliance type/name used for classification. |
| brand\_model | String | Asahi CF-835 | Manufacturer and model for reference and validation. |
| rated\_power\_watts | Integer | 65 W, 800 W | Nominal power rating of the appliance. |
| voltage\_rating | String | 220–240 V AC | Operating voltage range compatible with the smart plug. |

In addition, a sample entry for illustrative purposes is also shown in Table 3.4.

| household\_id | appliance\_id | device\_id | appliance\_name | brand\_model | rated\_power\_watts | voltage\_rating |

*Table 3.4. Sample Appliance Metadata Variables* 

#### **B. Smart Plug Variables** {#b.-smart-plug-variables}

Once registered, the system begins recording electrical measurements every ten (10) minutes. Each record contains both raw and processed variables to ensure data verification capability. Although the Tuya smart plug provides only the raw measurements (voltage, current, power, cumulative energy, switch status, device identifier, and timestamp), the logging script expands these readings into additional variables for validation and analysis. The logger records both the raw data point values and their processed equivalents, and also computes derived fields such as power factor (pf).

The timestamp field marks the exact time of data collection in UTC \+ 8 (DateTime), while the device\_id (String) associates each record with its corresponding Tuya Smart Socket. Core electrical parameters include voltage\_v (supply voltage, volts \[V\]), current\_a (instantaneous current, amperes \[A\]), and power\_w (real-time power draw, watts \[W\]). The cumulative energy reading for each device is stored as kwh\_total (kilowatt-hours \[kWh\]), while switch (Boolean) represents the device’s operational status, recorded as True when the socket is ON and False when it is OFF. The pf (decimal value) variable, or power-factor estimate, provides an indicator of electrical efficiency, while additional raw parameters, such as voltage\_raw (volts \[V\]), current\_raw (amperes \[A\]), power\_raw (watts \[W\]), and kwh\_raw (kilowatt-hours \[kWh\]), are retained for cross-checking and validation.

	To provide a clear overview of these measurements, Table 3.5 presents the complete list of smart-plug variables, their data types, formats/units, and descriptions.

| Variable Name | Type | Format / Unit | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| timestamp | DateTime | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | Exact moment the reading was logged (UTC+8). |
| device\_id | String | e.g., bf12abc345xyz | Tuya-assigned identifier of the smart socket. |
| switch | Boolean | True / False | Indicates whether the socket is turned ON (True) or OFF (False). |
| voltage\_raw | Float | Volts (V) | Raw voltage reading retrieved directly from the Tuya API. |
| current\_raw | Float | Amperes (A) | Raw current measurement before validation. |
| power\_raw | Float | Watts (W) | Raw instantaneous power reading from the API. |
| kwh\_raw | Float | kWh | Raw cumulative energy counter from the device. |
| voltage\_v | Float | Volts (V) | Cleaned and validated voltage value. |
| current\_a | Float | Amperes (A) | Cleaned and validated current value. |
| power\_w | Float | Watts (W) | Cleaned and validated real-time power draw. |
| kwh\_total | Float | kWh | Validated cumulative energy value. |
| pf | Float | 0.00–1.00 | Estimated power factor based on validated readings. |

*Table 3.5. Smart Plug Variables Structure*

	In addition, a sample of all recorded variables for illustrative purposes is shown in Table 3.6.

| timestamp | devide\_id | switch | voltage\_raw | current\_raw | power\_raw | kwh\_raw | voltage\_v | current\_a | power\_w | kwh\_total | pf |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00:00 | bf12abc345xyz | True | 228.5 | 0.31 | 70.8 | 0.024 | 228.5 | 0.31 | 70.8 | 0.024 | 0.92 |

| 2025-10-17 08:20:00 | bf12abc345xyz | True | 229.3 | 0.32 | 72.5 | 0.048 | 229.3 | 0.32 | 72.5 | 0.048 | 0.92 |

*Table 3.6 Sample Smart Plug Data Record*

#### **C. Weather Variables** {#c.-weather-variables}

To capture external usage influences, the study integrates weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, as exogenous variables that will later be used to enhance the accuracy of forecasting models.

##### **C.1 Primary Data Source** {#c.1-primary-data-source}

The OpenWeatherMap API serves as the primary source of weather data for this study. It enables hourly data logging, allowing the system to capture weather variations simultaneously with appliance-level energy readings. The API supports up requests per day under its free developer plan, which is sufficient enough for the participating household. 

A Python-based script running on the Cloud Virtual Machine (Microsoft Azure) retrieves the latest temperature, humidity, and rainfall measurements at hourly intervals. Each record includes a local timestamp (DateTime, UTC \+8), ensuring alignment with appliance energy data collected through the Tuya Cloud API. The temperature variable represents the ambient air temperature measured in degrees Celsius (°C), while humidity denotes the relative humidity expressed as a percentage (%). The rainfall variable indicates the amount of precipitation recorded within the previous hour, measured in millimeters (mm). To clearly present the structure of the weather dataset, Table 3.7 lists the variables, their types, formats, and descriptions.

| Variable Name | Type | Format / Unit | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| timestamp | DateTime | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | Local time (UTC+8) at which the weather measurement was recorded. |
| temperature | Float | Degrees Celsius (°C) | Ambient air temperature at the recorded time. |
| humidity | Float | Percentage (%) | Relative humidity level at the recorded time. |
| rainfall | Float | Millimeters (mm) | Precipitation amount recorded during the previous hour. |

*Table 3.7 Weather Variables Structure*

Additionally, a sample of the recorded weather variables for illustrative purposes is shown in Table 3.8.

| timestamp | temperature | humidity | rainfall |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00:00 | 32.4 | 6.7 | 0.0 |

*Table 3.8. Weather Variables*

##### **C.2 Supplementary Data Source** {#c.2-supplementary-data-source}

The Meteostat API is used as a supplementary data source for verification and comparison. It provides historical weather records, some sourced from PAGASA-affiliated meteorological stations, though with a typical one-day delay in availability. Once the monitoring period concludes, a complete Meteostat dataset covering the same timeframe is retrieved for cross-checking accuracy.

#### **D. Meralco Tariff Variables** {#d.-meralco-tariff-variables}

To achieve an accurate reference to the prevailing residential tariff rates, the study collects monthly tariff data directly from the official Meralco rate advisories, which are publicly released at the beginning of each billing month. These advisories provide the total cost of electricity in pesos per kilowatt-hour (₱/kWh), reflecting the combined charges for generation, transmission, distribution, system loss, and government taxes.

Each tariff record includes the month\_start (DateTime) representing the first day of the rate’s validity period, the month\_end (DateTime) marking when it expires, and the tariff\_rate (pesos per kilowatt-hour, ₱/kWh) indicating the total residential electricity rate applied for that billing month. These tariff records serve as the official reference data used by the system’s cost estimation component. 

To provide a clear overview of the structure and meaning of each tariff variable, Table 3.9 summarizes the fields, types, formats, and descriptions.

| Variable Name | Type | Format / Unit | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| month\_start | DateTime | YYYY-MM-DD | First day of the tariff’s validity period, based on the official Meralco advisory. |
| month\_end | DateTime | YYYY-MM-DD | Last day the tariff applies before a new adjustment is released. |
| tariff\_rate | Float / Decimal | ₱/kWh  | Total residential electricity rate in pesos per kilowatt-hour for the billing month. |

*Table 3.9 Meralco Tariff Variables*

Furthermore, a sample of the recorded tariff variables for illustrative purposes is presented in Table 3.10.

| month\_start | month\_end | tariff\_rate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-01 | 2025-10-31 | ₱11.95 |

*Table 3.10 Meralco Tariff Variables*

To validate accuracy, the study also utilizes the Meralco Appliance Calculator, an online tool that estimates household electricity costs based on power rating, duration of use, and the prevailing tariff rate. This comparison ensures that the system’s computed results remain consistent with actual household billing estimates.

#### **E. Big Data Characteristics (4 V’s)** {#e.-big-data-characteristics-(4-v’s)}

The complete dataset used in this study, consisting of two months of real high-resolution smart-plug measurements and twelve months of synthetic TimeGAN-generated profiles, exhibits the qualitative characteristics of Big Data within the context of IoT-driven residential energy monitoring. Although the system operates at the household scale, the continuous, multi-source, and heterogeneous nature of the data aligns with the 4V’s of Big Data. Understanding these characteristics is essential because they influence the design of the data pipeline, preprocessing workflow, synthetic generation procedures, and forecasting model.

1\. Volume  
Smart plugs record measurements every 10 minutes, producing 144 readings per appliance per day. 

Over the actual two-month monitoring period (60 days), each appliance generated: 144 x 60 \= 8, 640 real observations. 

With (3) monitored appliances, the real dataset contains: 8, 640 x 3 \= 25, 920 appliance-level real records.

When the twelve (12) synthetic months are appended using TimeGAN for the same three appliances, an additional: 144 x 305 synthetic days x 3 appliances \= 131, 760 synthetic records are added to the dataset.

This results in 157,680 appliance-level records at a 10-minute resolution. Hourly weather data contributes an additional 8,760 entries, which are synchronized with the energy dataset. Overall, the final dataset comprises approximately 166,440 records across all data sources.

Although the full dataset contains approximately 157, 680 ten-minute observations, the data used for SARIMAX forecasting is aggregated to hourly intervals. Aggregation reduces the series to hourly points per appliance, improving model stability while maintaining the original volume characteristics for the Big Data assessment.

This extended volume introduces data engineering challenges typical of Big Data systems:

* Higher storage requirements due to long-term high-frequency data  
* Greater computational cost for cleaning, aggregation, and validation  
* The need for efficient file structures (organized by appliance and by time)  
* Longer historical windows to support annual seasonality and multi-month forecasting

Although small compared to enterprise-scale datasets, the final 14-month dataset becomes substantial within a residential IoT setting and is large enough to require systematic processing pipelines.

2\. Velocity  
The system handles multiple data streams operating at different time intervals:

* Smart plug telemetry every 10 minutes  
* Weather data every hour  
* Logger ingestion processes occurring continuously  
* Dashboard updates occurring in near real time during system operation

This multi-stream velocity introduces Big Data challenges, such as:

* Real-time ingestion via the Azure VM Python logger  
* Handling API delays, missing pings, or intermittent connectivity  
* Ensuring synchronization across different update frequencies  
* Updating the forecast and cost dashboard with fresh data

Because forecasting depends on the most recent values, the system must process incoming data quickly enough to maintain up-to-date consumption profiles. This velocity characteristic directly influences the design of the automation scripts, the fallback estimation rules, and the rate at which the forecasting model is recalculated.

3\. Variety  
The dataset integrates multiple heterogeneous sources, each differing in structure, purpose, and temporal granularity:

* Real IoT Smart Plug Data: voltage, current, power, and energy (10-minute numerical time series)  
* GAN-Generated Synthetic Data: Twelve (12) months of reconstructed appliance-level profiles for each monitored appliance, generated to follow validated statistical and temporal patterns.  
* Weather Data: temperature, humidity, rainfall (hourly environmental time series)  
* Tariff Data: monthly electricity rates (reference table)  
* Appliance Metadata: device categories, watt ratings, locations (static descriptive data)

	To demonstrate the heterogeneous structure of the dataset, the following tables present sample entries from each data source, illustrating variety:

A. Smart Plug Data (10-minute intervals)

| timestamp | device\_id | switch | voltage\_raw | current\_raw | power\_raw | kwh\_raw |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1H1P | Electric Fan | Asahi CF-835 | 65 W | 220–240 V AC |

*Table 3.15 Appliance Metadata*

Each table presents only a simplified subset of variables to illustrate the structural format of each data source, while the full variable definitions are provided in Section 3.2.3. Such diversity requires a flexible and carefully coordinated pipeline capable of:

* Parsing heterogeneous formats and schemas  
* Standardizing units and physical scales  
* Merging time series with different resolutions  
* Aligning real and synthetic datasets into a single continuous structure  
* Supporting both consumption forecasting and cost estimation

The inclusion of synthetic months significantly increases dataset variety because generative models introduce reconstructed temporal sequences that must remain compatible with real-world measurements.

4\. Veracity  
Veracity refers to the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of the data, an essential requirement for forecasting tasks. Both real and synthetic components of the dataset must satisfy high veracity standards.

For smart plug data, issues may arise during collection and transmission, resulting in irregularities or gaps that affect the accuracy of the recorded measurements. These issues include the following:

* Missing 10-minute intervals  
* Device measurement errors  
* Load fluctuations causing noisy readings  
* Cumulative reset anomalies  
* Temporary API outages

To address these issues, the data pipeline applies a sequence of validation and correction mechanisms designed to restore accuracy, continuity, and physical consistency in the dataset. These measures include the following:

* Physical consistency checks (P \= V × I × PF)  
* Tolerance rules for detecting abnormal deviations  
* Fallback estimation for missing intervals  
* Cumulative reset correction  
* Validation of hourly totals before modeling

On the other hand, for weather data, irregularities may occur due to API transmission delays, temporary gaps in reporting, or environmental readings that fall outside expected ranges. These issues may include the following:

* Missing hourly weather points  
* API latency  
* Occasional irregularities in rainfall or humidity data  
* Your system resolves these through:  
* Forward-fill imputation  
* Timestamp validation  
* Accuracy checks based on plausible environmental ranges

To address these issues, the preprocessing workflow applies correction and validation procedures to ensure environmental data accuracy and completeness. These measures include the following:

* Forward-fill imputation for missing hourly data  
* Plausibility checks using realistic environmental thresholds  
* Timestamp validation to ensure alignment with energy data  
* Consistency checks across temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns

	Furthermore, for synthetic data veracity, the twelve months of reconstructed data must match the statistical distribution and temporal structure of the real dataset. This ensures veracity through:

* Statistical comparison (mean, variance, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis)  
* PCA similarity analysis  
* t-SNE neighborhood consistency plots  
* Denormalization and reconstruction checks  
* Energy-scaling alignment with Meralco bills

These steps ensure that synthetic months remain physically plausible and consistent with the participating household’s observed behavior High veracity across real, environmental, and synthetic data ensures that the SARIMAX forecasting model receives a clean, coherent, and trustworthy 14-month dataset. The resulting dataset supports accurate modeling of daily, weekly, and annual patterns and enables robust appliance-level energy forecasting and cost estimation.

## **3.3 Data Preprocessing and Preparation** {#3.3-data-preprocessing-and-preparation}

This section describes how the raw readings recorded from the Tuya smart plug and weather sources are transformed into a modeling-ready dataset. The preprocessing stage ensures that all recorded values are physically consistent, temporally continuous, and properly synchronized with the corresponding environmental conditions before being used for forecasting and analysis. The procedure follows a four-stage sequence: (1) Data Integrity Verification and Standardization, (2) Cleaning and Energy Derivation, (3) Hourly Aggregation and Feature Construction, and (4) Final Dataset Assembly.

It is important to note that only the smart-plug and weather datasets undergo the preprocessing and preparation procedures. Meanwhile, the appliance metadata serves only as a descriptive reference, and the electricity tariff is separately used for cost computations in later stages.

### **3.3.0 Tuya API Log Restructuring and Variable Reconstruction** {#3.3.0-tuya-api-log-restructuring-and-variable-reconstruction}

Before data integrity checks and physics-based validation can be applied, the raw energy logs retrieved from the Tuya Cloud API must first be restructured and normalized. Unlike the modeling-ready smart-plug dataset described in later stages, the Tuya export is recorded in a long-format key–value structure, where each timestamped record contains only a single device property and its corresponding value. This subsection describes the preprocessing steps used to convert the raw Tuya logs into a horizontal, time-indexed dataset and subsequently reconstruct the electrical variables required for analysis.

#### **0\. Daily Energy Log Consolidation**

Before the restructuring, scaling, and validation stages (Stages A–E) can be applied, the raw Tuya energy logs must first be consolidated. During data acquisition, the energy logger exports one CSV file per day, each containing all data points recorded within that calendar date. Since subsequent preprocessing steps assume a continuous time-series input, these daily logs are merged into a single master dataset ordered from the earliest monitored date (20260103) to the most recent available file.

All daily CSV files are first collected from the monitoring directory. Each filename contains an 8-digit date stamp in the format: YYYYMMDD

	This date stamp is extracted from each filename and used as the sorting key. The files are then ordered chronologically. This ordering guarantees that earlier days are appended before later days, preserving the natural temporal sequence of logging.

Once ordered, the daily datasets are merged through row-wise concatenation. At this stage, the dataset remains in its original Tuya long-format structure, where each row represents a single (timestamp, device, property) observation. No reshaping, scaling, or validation is performed yet; this step ensures only that all datapoints across the monitoring period are contained in a single table.

After concatenation, all records are sorted globally by timestamp in ascending order. Because Tuya exports may contain overlapping records at daily boundaries (for example, the same polling instant appearing at the end of one file and the beginning of the next), duplicate entries are screened using the tuple: (timestamp, device, property)

If duplicates are detected, only one instance is retained to prevent double-counting during subsequent pivoting, scaling, and energy computations.

#### **A. Long-to-Wide Restructuring of Tuya Datapoints** {#a.-long-to-wide-restructuring-of-tuya-datapoints}

Each Tuya API response records appliance telemetry as multiple rows sharing the same timestamp and device identifier, but differing in the reported property. Table X illustrates a typical raw snapshot returned by the API at a single polling instant, where voltage, current, power, energy counters, and control flags are stored as separate records.

Presented in Table 3.1 is an example of a the default retrieved data from TUYA API

| timestamp | device | property |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | switch\_1 |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | countdown\_1 |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | add\_ele |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | cur\_current |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | cur\_power |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | cur\_voltage |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | voltage\_coe |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | electric\_coe |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | power\_coe |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | electricity\_coe |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | fault |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | relay\_status |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | overcharge\_switch |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | light\_mode |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | child\_lock |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | cycle\_time |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | random\_time |
| 2026-01-03 14:35:47 | Aircon | switch\_inching |

Although these values are logged simultaneously, they are not directly usable for time-series modeling in their vertical form. Therefore, the first preprocessing operation restructures the dataset into a horizontal format, producing one row per timestamp per device, with each Tuya property represented as a column.

This restructuring is performed through an operation defined as follows:

* Index: timestamp, device  
* Columns: property  
* Values: corresponding Tuya-reported value

After this, all properties associated with the same timestamp are consolidated into a single record.

#### **B. Selection and Mapping of Energy-Relevant Tuya Datapoints** {#b.-selection-and-mapping-of-energy-relevant-tuya-datapoints}

Once the Tuya log has been restructured into a horizontal format, the next step identifies which of the available Tuya data points correspond to electrical energy measurements required for analysis. Although the horizontal table contains numerous operational and configuration parameters, only a subset directly describes appliance energy behavior.

From the full set of Tuya properties, the preprocessing pipeline selects the following energy-relevant datapoints:

* switch\_1 – device ON/OFF state  
* cur\_voltage – instantaneous voltage reading  
* cur\_current – instantaneous current reading  
* cur\_power – instantaneous active power  
* add\_ele – cumulative electrical energy counter

All remaining fields, such as countdown timers, relay flags, child locks, random timers, and calibration coefficients, such as voltage\_coe, electric\_coe, power\_coe, are excluded from the modeling dataset at this stage. These parameters do not represent physical energy consumption and are therefore not required for forecasting or cost estimation. However, their presence in the original wide-format table allows later inspection if device-specific calibration issues arise.

After selection, the Tuya-specific property names are mapped into the study’s standardized smart-plug variable naming convention. This ensures consistency across appliances and aligns the dataset with the schema defined in the data collection stage.

The mapping is defined as follows:

* switch\_1 to switch  
* cur\_voltage to voltage\_raw  
* cur\_current to current\_raw  
* cur\_power to power\_raw  
* add\_ele to kwh\_raw

At this point, the values remain raw, meaning they retain the numeric representation provided by the Tuya API and have not yet been validated or corrected. The variables are simply renamed and isolated to create a clean bridge between the device-specific telemetry and the thesis-wide smart-plug schema.

#### **C. Unit Scaling and Conversion to Engineering Quantities**

	After the relevant Tuya datapoints have been isolated and mapped to the standardized variable names, the next step converts these raw values into meaningful engineering units. Although the variables are now semantically aligned, the Tuya API often reports electrical measurements as scaled integers rather than direct physical quantities. Therefore, numerical scaling must be applied before any physics-based validation can be performed.

Each raw electrical variable is converted using a predefined scale factor derived from Tuya’s device specifications and empirically verified during data inspection. The general scaling relationship applied to all raw measurements is expressed as:  
![][image5]Equation 3.1

where Xraw is the integer value reported by the device and SX is the corresponding scale factor for that parameter. For the smart plug devices used in this study, the following conversions are applied:

* Voltage

![][image6]  
where cur\_voltage values such as 2293 are interpreted as 229.3 V.

* Current

![][image7]  
where a reported value of 310 corresponds to 0.31 A.

* Power

![][image8]  
where a raw value of 708 represents 70.8 W.

* Cumulative Energy

![][image9]  
where a reported counter value of 48 corresponds to 0.48 kWh.

#### **D. Derivation and Initialization of Power Factor**

With voltage, current, power, and cumulative energy now expressed in consistent engineering units, the final variable required to complete the smart-plug schema is the power factor (pf). The Tuya API does not consistently provide a direct power factor reading across devices; therefore, power factor is estimated analytically from the scaled electrical measurements.

Power factor is defined as the ratio between real (active) power and apparent power. For each timestamped record, it is computed as:  
![][image10]  
	  
This computation is applied only under valid load conditions. When the socket is switched OFF (switch \= False) or when the measured current is zero, the appliance is assumed to be in a no-load state and the power factor is set to zero:  
![][image11]

To maintain physical plausibility, all computed power factor values are constrained within the theoretical bounds:  
![][image12]

Any value exceeding unity due to measurement noise or rounding is clipped to 1.00, while negative values are set to 0.00.

#### **E. Appliance-Specific Dataset Segmentation**

After the smart-plug schema has been fully reconstructed (Stages A–D), the resulting dataset still contains readings from multiple appliances in a single table. Because each appliance is modeled independently in later stages, the final step of this subsection divides the dataset into separate appliance-specific files, producing one CSV per monitored load.

Each record already includes the identifier of the source plug through device\_id. Using this identifier, the dataset is partitioned into three subsets corresponding to the three appliances used in the study:

* Air Conditioner dataset: all rows where device\_id \= Aircon  
* Refrigerator dataset: all rows where device\_id \= Refrigerator  
* Electric Fan dataset: all rows where device\_id \= Electric\_Fan

	  
	Formally, for a given appliance a, the extracted dataset is:  
![][image13]  
where xi represents a complete smart-plug observation row containing:  
timestamp, device\_id, switch, voltage\_raw, current\_raw, power\_raw, kwh\_raw, voltage\_v, current\_a, power\_w, kwh\_total, pf.

To ensure that the exported files remain usable for the next preprocessing stages, each appliance subset is sorted chronologically:  
![][image14]

	This segmentation ensures that each appliance’s energy behavior is isolated before data integrity verification (Section 3.3.1), preventing cross-device mixing and allowing appliance-specific validation, correction, and forecasting to be applied consistently across the pipeline.

### **3.3.1 Data Integrity Verification and Standardization** {#3.3.1-data-integrity-verification-and-standardization}

Following data collection, the first stage focuses on verifying the structure and validity of all input data. Before any computation, the raw files are examined to confirm that their columns, data types, and time formats are correct.

#### **A. Schema Alignment and Unit Validation** {#a.-schema-alignment-and-unit-validation}

	Each dataset follows a defined schema. After collection, the smart-plug dataset contains timestamped electrical readings that describe appliance-level energy behavior, while the weather dataset provides environmental parameters corresponding to each observation period. Both CSV files must follow the expected structure and declare consistent measurement units. Each file is inspected to confirm the presence of the required columns and proper data types. The declared measurement units, such as volts, amperes, watts, and kilowatt-hours for the smart plug, and degrees, percentage, and millimeters for the weather data, are checked for consistency across all files.

Both of the expected smart-plug and weather schemas are defined in the data collection stage. For illustration, Table 3.6 presents three consecutive 10-minute readings from one appliance, showing the structure of the smart-plug data used in this stage. Similarly, Table 3.8 presents an hourly record of weather variables. All timestamps are standardized to UTC+8, ensuring synchronization between the energy and weather datasets.

#### **B. Time Standardization and Ordering** {#b.-time-standardization-and-ordering}

	Once the schema and units have been verified, all timestamps are standardized to Philippine Standard Time (UTC \+8) to ensure temporal consistency across datasets. Each device’s data is then sorted chronologically so that the sequence of readings reflects the actual order in which they were recorded.

For the smart-plug dataset, the expected interval between consecutive readings is 600 seconds (10 minutes). To confirm this, the time difference between successive timestamps is calculated as:  
interval\_secondsi=timestampi-timestampi-1              *Equation 3.2*  
If the smart plug data’s internal\_seconds \= 600, the data sequence is considered continuous. Any deviation from this expected interval is flagged for review and correction in the next preprocessing stage. Similarly, for the weather dataset (Table 3.8), the time difference between successive records is computed using the same Equation (a). If the weather data’s internal\_secondsweather \= 3600, the weather data is confirmed to be recorded at consistent one-hour intervals. In the sample smart-plug values from Table 3.6, all three records are exactly ten minutes apart, confirming that the data were captured continuously.

#### **C. Physics Consistency and Scaling Verification** {#c.-physics-consistency-and-scaling-verification}

At this stage, numerical validation begins to ensure that all recorded values reflect realistic electrical behavior and that any integer-scaled “raw” readings are correctly converted into engineering units. This verification is applied to all readings and follows a physics-guided procedure, from recomputing voltage, current, power, and cumulative energy from their raw values, comparing the recomputed and scaled values to detect incorrect scaling, to adjusting scaling factors per appliance if consistent mismatches are found, then re-run all dependent computations. The general scaling relation is applied depending on the scale factor assigned to each parameter based on TUYA's specifications. For the sample dataset in Table 3.6, the readings are already in scaled engineering units. However, this verification step is still performed to ensure consistency across different devices. In this case, if the raw and scaled values match exactly, it requires no further conversion.

##### **C.1 Recomputation of Power** {#c.1-recomputation-of-power}

With scaled voltage (V) and current (I) available, power is re-derived from the measured voltage, current, and estimated power factor (pf), calculated as:  
Pcalc=VIpf                               *Equation 3.3*  
If the deviation, solved using the percentage deviation formula below,  
Deviation= Preported \- PcalcPcalc100%                      *Equation 3.4*  
between the computed power and the device-recorded power is within ±5 %, the recorded value is accepted. Otherwise, computed power replaces it. This ensures that all power readings remain physically consistent. As an example, for the 08:00 AM reading (Table 3.6).

| Given that V \= 228.5 V, I \= 0.31 A, pf \=0.92, Precorded=70.8 W   Then Pcalc=228.5  0.31  0.92=65.2 W The plug reported 70.8 W. The deviation is therefore is 70.8-65.270.8100=7.9%. |
| :---- |

	Although slightly above the 5% threshold, this difference is acceptable for demonstration purposes. In the actual preprocessing pipeline, however, such a case would trigger automatic re-evaluation of scaling parameters.

##### **C.2 Recomputation of Cumulative Energy** {#c.2-recomputation-of-cumulative-energy}

After interval energies are computed in the next stage, the cumulative total energy is verified using the formula below:  
kWhtotal=Einterval                                     *Equation 3.5*  
The recomputed cumulative values are then compared with the plug’s recorded kWh readings to confirm that no scaling errors occurred during logging. Using the data from Table 3.6,

| Given that Et1=0.024 kWh, Et2=0.036 kWh, and Et3=0.048 kWh Then the interval energy between 08:00 and 08:10 is E08:10-08:00=Et2=Et1=0.036-0.024=0.012 kWh Using a similar equation, between 08:10 and 08:20, the E08:20-0:10=0.012 kWh The cumulative total is then verified as Et3=Et1+E=0.024+(0.012+0.012)=0.048 kWh. |
| :---- |

	Since the recomputed Et3 matches the plug’s recorded value (0.048 kWh), the cumulative energy is confirmed consistent, indicating no scaling or accumulation errors during logging.

##### **C.3 Comparison and Tolerance Rule** {#c.3-comparison-and-tolerance-rule}

To maintain accuracy, Pcalc is compared against both the device-recorded Precorded and, if available, scaled Praw,scaled.

If the median absolute percentage deviation over a calibration window exceeds 5 %, scaling factors are corrected per appliance and all dependent fields are recomputed, then re-run the kWh. Otherwise, the recorded values are retained.

##### **C.4 Validation Ranges and Plausibility Screening** {#c.4-validation-ranges-and-plausibility-screening}

	​All variables are screened against expected household operating ranges, in accordance to International Electrotechnical Commission, to ensure physical plausibility:

* Voltage: 220 – 240 V  
* Current: \> 0 A and typically \< 15 A (when switch\_1 \= True)  
* Power: \> 0 W and typically \< 3000 W (when switch\_1 \= True)  
* Power factor: 0.85 – 1.00

.	  
These ranges act as checks to ensure that the smart plugs are correctly capturing data that aligns with typical household conditions and usage. If any recorded values fall outside these ranges, it might signal a problem, and those values will be flagged for further review and potential correction through physics-based recomputation.

##### **C.5 Power Factor Consistency Check** {#c.5-power-factor-consistency-check}

Finally, the measured power factor is recalculated to verify its alignment with the estimated power factor. This is calculated below:  
pf=PV  I                                             *Equation 3.6*  
Using the values for the 08:00AM record from Table 3.6,

| Given that P=70.8, V=228.5, I=0.31 The power factor is obtained by pfcalc=70.8(228.50.31)=0.99. |
| :---- |

The recalculated power factor falls within the expected range (0.85 – 1.00). Persistent divergence between pfcalc and pf triggers recalibration of Pcalc and a re-evaluation of the tolerance rule. The raw energy data (kWh\_raw) is is kept alongside the scaled data (kWhraw,scaled) to maintain transparency and enable auditing. The recorded cumulative energy used over time is stored as kwh\_total.

### **3.3.2 Data Cleaning and Energy Derivation** {#3.3.2-data-cleaning-and-energy-derivation}

	The next stage computes the energy consumed per interval. This involves deriving energy values from the cumulative energy counter, applying fallback calculations for incomplete readings, and validating each interval with a hybrid decision rule. Additional procedures handle temporary gaps, resets, and outliers to maintain consistent energy profiles across the monitoring period.

#### **A. Interval Energy Computation** {#a.-interval-energy-computation}

The Tuya smart plug records the total cumulative energy as kWh\_total. To obtain the actual energy consumed in each 10-minute interval, the difference between consecutive cumulative readings is computed. The formula is expressed:  
Einterval=max(0, kWh\_totalt-kWh\_totalt-1)             *Equation 3.7*

Using the values from 08:00 AM to 08:10 AM from Table 3.6

| Given that Et1=0.024 and Et2=0.035 Then Einterval=max(0,0.035-0.024)=0.011 kWh |
| :---- |

	So, the interval energy values are calculated as 0.011 kWh, and the same is applied for further intervals. If the cumulative meter temporarily freezes, resets, or a record is missing, the system computes a fallback energy estimate using the average power and elapsed time between the two readings, using the Equation 3.8 for calculating the average power and Equation 3.9 for calculating the energy\_fallback.  
Efallback=Pˉ  t (in milliseconds)3,600,000                                  *Equation 3.8*  
Pˉ=Pt \+ Pt-12                                           *Equation 3.9*  
Using the values from Table 3.6,

| Given that Pt1=70.8 W, Pt2=66.0 W, t=600 seconds \= 600,000 milliseconds Then, to compute the average power, Pavg=66.0+70.82=68.4 W  Finally, to compute the fall energy Efallback=68.46000003600000=0.0114 |
| :---- |

	After both values are calculated, a hybrid selection rule determines which value is retained as the validated interval energy. The final energy for each interval (energy\_final) is determined based on the following conditions:

1. If both interval energy (energy\_interval) and fallback energy (energy\_fallback) are available:  
* The final energy will be the interval energy (energy\_interval), provided that the absolute difference between the two is less than or equal to 10%.  
2. If the cumulative reading is missing, negative, or inconsistent, the final energy will be based on the fallback energy (energy\_fallback).  
3. If the switch is OFF (switch \= False), the final energy will be 0, regardless of the other conditions.

Where:

* Einterval is the direct energy difference from the cumulative meter (preferred when consistent)  
* Efallback is the physics-based estimate using average power and time  
* Efinal is the validated hybrid energy for downstream calculations

	To demonstrate this process, the same readings from Table 3.6 are used for illustration.

| Timestamp | Voltage (V) | Current (A) | Power (W) | kWh Total | Interval Δ (kWh) | Fallback (kWh) | Final (kWh) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 228.5 | 0.31 | 70.8 | 0.024 |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-17 08:10 | 229.0 | 0.32 | 71.5 | 0.035 | 0.011 | 0.0118 | 0.011 |
| 2025-10-17 08:20 | 230.2 | 0.33 | 72.0 | 0.046 | 0.011 | 0.0120 | 0.011 |

*Table 3.16 Interval Energy Derivation Using Cumulative and Fallback Methods*

	The difference between ΔkWh and fallback is approximately 7%, which is within the acceptable range (≤10%), so the cumulative difference value is retained. This same validation process is applied to all intervals within the dataset to ensure consistent energy values.

B. Handling Gaps, Resets, and Outliers  
	If any interruptions or anomalies occur, In practical data collection, each situation is handled through a defined rule to preserve both physical accuracy and temporal continuity.

1\. Minor gaps (≤ 20 minutes).  
When a single 10-minute reading is missing but the neighboring records are available, the voltage, current, and power values are estimated using linear interpolation between the two surrounding points, shown in Equation 9\.  
Vmissing=Vbefore+(Vafter-Vbefore)2                             *Equation 3.10*  
For example, if voltage readings are available at 08:00 and 08:20 but missing at 08:10, the interpolated value is computed as:

| V08:10=V08:00+V08:20-V08:002=229 V. |
| :---- |

The same procedure applies to current and power, using Equation (j), where n is the number of sub-intervals between timestamps. These interpolated values are used for diagnostics and continuity validation, not for generating new energy values. If the missing interval affects energy computation, a fallback estimate is recalculated using interpolated power (Equation 3.9), and the hybrid validation rule finalizes the interval energy.

2\. Long gaps (\> 20 minutes).  
If an appliance goes offline for an extended period, interpolation is avoided, and the energy for those intervals is recorded as 0 kWh to maintain chronological structure without distorting cumulative totals.

3\. Cumulative resets.  
If the cumulative energy counter (kwh\_total) decreases, often due to a restart, the affected interval’s ΔkWh becomes invalid. In this case, the interval energy is set to 0, and a fallback energy is recomputed using Equation (3.9). The hybrid rule then selects the valid final value.

4\. Outliers or spikes.  
Occasionally, the plug may register implausible readings. In such cases, voltage, current, and power readings are replaced with the nearest-neighbor rolling mean, using the formula below:  
Rolling Mean=1ni=0n-1xt-i                           *Equation 3.11*

As an example, assume a power reading at 08:10 AM is flagged as implausible. Using the data in Table 3.6, the neighboring valid reading is at 08:00 AM and 08:20 AM.

| Given that P08:00=70 w, and P08:20=72 W The rolling mean of these two values would be Rolling Mean \= 70 \+ 722=71 W. |
| :---- |

	  
	The flagged value is replaced with 71 W and a new fallback energy is derived and validated using the hybrid rule.

#### **C Daily Consistency Check** {#c-daily-consistency-check}

	After all intervals are validated, a final check ensures the total daily energy aligns with the cumulative progression of the smart plug’s meter. The sum of all validated interval energies should match the net change in the cumulative reading between the first and last records of the day. The total energy for the day can be approximated using the formula:  
Efinal(day)kWh\_total(end day)-kWh\_total(start day) *Equation 3.12*  
The deviation is expressed as:  
Deviation=Total Energy-Cumulative EnergyCumulative Energy100%           *Equation 3.13*  
If the deviation exceeds 5%, the affected intervals are flagged and automatically reprocessed through the hybrid validation rule until consistency is achieved. Using the data from Table 3.16,

| Given those values, the total energy for the day is Total Energy=0.011+0.011=0.022 kWh The cumulative energy (net change from the first to the last cumulative reading) Cumulative Energy \= 0.046-0.024=0.022 kWh Therefore, the deviation is Deviation=0.022-0.0220.022100=0% |
| :---- |

	  
Since the deviation is 0%, which is within the acceptable range (5%), no further action is needed. At the end of this stage, each 10-minute record contains a verified, physics-consistent measure of energy consumption. All corrections are logged for traceability with tags, ensuring full transparency of this pipeline.

D. Visual Inspection and Time-Series Diagnostics  
	As a final validation step, diagnostic time-series plots are generated for each appliance to verify that sensor readings exhibit consistent behavior. The following plots are created for each appliance:

* Power (W) vs. Time: Observes ON/OFF patterns and daily usage cycles.  
* Voltage (V) and Current (A) vs. Time: Ensures voltage stays within the expected range (220–240 V) and current changes align with power  
* Cumulative Energy (kWh\_total) vs. Time: Confirms the cumulative energy increases monotonically, indicating valid metering without resets or gaps.

These plots allow for quick identification of scaling errors, device resets, or extended idle periods. They provide a final check to ensure that the data is physically plausible and structurally complete before modeling.

### **3.3.3 Data Aggregation and Feature Construction** {#3.3.3-data-aggregation-and-feature-construction}

	After validating and cleaning the interval-level energy values, the data is aggregated into hourly records and enriched with exogenous features. This ensures alignment of variables on a consistent time scale.

#### **A. Hourly Resampling** {#a.-hourly-resampling}

	Each smart plug records readings every 10 minutes. To create hourly energy totals, the six validated 10-minute intervals within the hour are summed using the formula below:  
Ehour=i=16Efinal(i)                                       *Equation 3.14*  
This produces the total energy consumed during each one-hour period. After aggregation, a reconciliation step compares the aggregated total to the cumulative (kWh\_total) for the same hour. If the deviation exceeds 5%, affected intervals are reprocessed using the hybrid recomputation rule to ensure alignment. Using the same values in Table 3.16 (assuming they represent 1 hour),

| Given that Einterval1=0.011 kWh, Einterval2=0.022 kWh, Erecorded=0.022 kWh Ehour=0.011+0.011=0.022 kWh The deviation would be: Deviation \= 0.022-0.0220.022100 \= 0%. This gives the total energy consumed during the 1-hour period. |
| :---- |

#### **B. Validation of Weather Data** {#b.-validation-of-weather-data}

	Weather inputs from the OpenWeatherMap API validation procedure. This multi-stage process prioritizes intrinsic data checks before external comparisons, ensuring that only physically and temporally consistent weather data are used.

1\. Range validation (physical plausibility).  
All weather variables are checked to ensure they fall within realistic physical limits. Values outside these boundaries are removed and handled using interpolation below:  
Tmissing=Tbefore+(Tafter-Tbefore)  (tmissing-tbefore)(tafter-tbefore)                *Equation 3.15*

* Temperature: \-10°C \< T \< 45°C  
* Humidity: 0 \< Humidity ≤ 100%  
* Rainfall: rainfall ≥0

For example, if temperatures at 08:00 AM and 10:00 AM are 32.4°C and 32°C, 

| The temperature at 09:00 AM could be interpolated as: T09:00=28+32-282=30°C |
| :---- |

2\. Temporal consistency check.  
	Excessive hour-to-hour changes in weather data are flagged, as they often indicate sensor errors or glitches. The following thresholds are applied:

* | ΔT | \> 5°C per hour  
* | Δhumidity | \> 20% per hour

Values exceeding these thresholds are corrected using the nearest valid measurements. The erroneous value is typically replaced with a linearly interpolated value based on nearby valid readings (Equation o). This can also be illustrated using the interpolation method applied in the previous computation.

3\. Cross-source comparison.  
If anomalies persist after internal validation, data are cross-checked with an independent reference. Discrepancies beyond thresholds trigger manual inspection and correction. This ensures the weather data is both physically plausible and externally verified when needed.

#### **C. Derived Time and Historical Features** {#c.-derived-time-and-historical-features}

	To improve the predictive capability of the model, additional features are derived from timestamps and energy data, capturing cyclical time patterns and autocorrelation.

1\. Calendar and time-based features.  
These features help identify patterns like peak-hour usage, weekend consumption, and holiday usage. From each hourly timestamp, the following time indicators are extracted:

* hour of day \= t mod 24  
* day of week \= t mod 7  
* is\_weekend \= 1 if day of week ∈ {6, 7}, else 0  
* Is\_holiday \= 1 if the date corresponds to an official Philippine holiday, else 0

2\. Historical (Lagged) features.  
Lagged energy variables are created to capture autocorrelation across time:

* Lag24 \= Et-24h   
* Lag168 \= Et-168h

For example, lag\_24 represents energy consumption at the same hour on the previous day, and lag\_168 captures energy consumption from the same hour a week earlier.

3\. Rolling (moving average) features.  
To smooth fluctuations and highlight recent trends, rolling averages are computed over 24-hour (Equation p) and 168-hour (Equation q) windows:  
rolling\_mean24=124t-24tEt                                *Equation 3.16*  
rolling\_mean168=1168t-168tEt                   	          *Equation 3.17*  
These averages help capture trends like gradual changes in energy demand due to temperature or behavior. For example,

| Given hourly energy data for a few hours: Et1=0.024, Et2=0.035, Et3=0.046 and so on up to Et24 The 24-hour rolling mean is computed as: rolling24=0.024 \+ 0.035 \+ 0.046+...+E2424 Similarly, for a 168-hour rolling mean (weekly window), the calculation is: rolling168=0.024 \+ 0.035 \+ 0.046+...+E168168 |
| :---- |

This procedure aggregates the data over the past 24 hours for the 24-hour rolling mean, and over the past 168 hours for the 168-hour rolling mean. Since the SARIMAX model handles seasonality, trigonometric encodings are not required. Starting from two months of 10-minute smart-plug readings (144 points per day), the data for each appliance were aggregated into hourly totals, yielding 1,440 hourly observations per appliance for the real monitoring period.

### **3.3.4 Final Data Transformation** {#3.3.4-final-data-transformation}

The final stage consolidates all processed variables into a single, modeling-ready dataset. This integrates hourly energy consumption with environmental and temporal attributes, forming the complete input for forecasting and cost estimation.

#### **A. Weather Synchronization** {#a.-weather-synchronization}

Since the smart plug data has already been aggregated into validated hourly energy totals and the weather data is collected at an hourly frequency, these two time-series inputs must be synchronized before final modeling. Only these variables require synchronization, because they share a temporal structure and must refer to the same hour for the SARIMAX model to correctly associate consumption with environmental conditions.

The smart plug readings, originally captured at 10-minute intervals, are first aggregated into hourly kWh. Weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API is already provided at an hourly resolution. Once both datasets have been validated, each hourly energy value is paired with its corresponding temperature, humidity, and rainfall measurements. Synchronization is performed by aligning both datasets through a timestamp-based merge, ensuring that every hour contains a complete and accurately matched set of energy and weather attributes.

For clarification, tariff data and appliance metadata are not part of the synchronization process. Tariff values are incorporated only after forecasting during the cost-estimation phase, and therefore do not require temporal alignment with the model inputs. Likewise, appliance metadata is static descriptive information used for labeling, analysis, and dashboard visualization. Because it does not vary over time, it is not included in the time-series synchronization step.

	This synchronization stage results in a unified hourly dataset. For example, the synchronized hourly record for 08:00–09:00 is:

| Timestamp | Total Energy | Temperature | Humidity | Rainfall |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 0.022 | 32.4 | 6.7 | 0.0 |

*Table 3.17 Hourly Aggregated Energy with Corresponding Weather Variables*

#### **B. Final Variable Structure for Modeling** {#b.-final-variable-structure-for-modeling}

	The compiled dataset includes the validated hourly appliance-level energy target, synchronized weather features, and derived temporal and historical predictors. The final variable structure for modeling is summarized below:

| Variable | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| timestamp | datetime | Hour start (UTC+8) |
| kWh | float | Validated hourly energy target |
| temperature | float | Ambient air temperature (°C) |
| humidity | float | Relative humidity (%) |
| rainfall | float | Precipitation per hour (mm) |
| hour\_of\_day | int | Hour of the day (0–23) |
| day\_of\_week | int | Day of the week (1–7) |
| is\_weekend | binary | 0 \= weekday, 1 \= weekend |
| is\_holiday | binary | 0 \= not holiday, 1 \= holiday |
| lag\_24 | float | kWh recorded at the same hour of the previous day |
| lag\_168 | float | kWh recorded at the same hour of the previous week |
| rolling\_mean\_24 | float | Average kWh over the preceding 24 hours |
| rolling\_mean\_168 | float | Average kWh over the preceding 168 hours (7 days) |

*Table 3.18 Final Variable Structure of the Modeling-Ready Dataset for Energy Forecasting*

	Each variable describes energy usage behavior over time, environmental changes, and historical trends. Meanwhile, the timestamp serves as the temporal index, defining the hourly frequency used by the SARIMAX model. It is not included as a regressor since its information is encoded in the temporal features and the model’s inherent time structure. All variables retain their original units to preserve interpretability. Since the SARIMAX model operates effectively on raw data, no normalization or standardization is required. At the end of this stage, the pipeline outputs three (3) preprocessed real datasets, one for each monitored appliance.

## **3.4 Synthetic Data Generation Using TimeGAN** {#3.4-synthetic-data-generation-using-timegan}

This section describes how the study reconstructs a complete 14-month, high-resolution household electricity dataset using a generative deep-learning model. This process is essential because only two months of appliance-level smart plug measurements are available from the actual monitoring period, which is insufficient to support seasonal analysis, pattern extraction, and forecasting model training.

To address this limitation, the study employs an Improved TimeGAN model based on the architecture presented by Tang et al. (2025). TimeGAN (Time-series Generative Adversarial Network) is specifically designed to learn temporal relationships within multivariate sequences. In this study, the Improved TimeGAN serves as a data reconstruction engine rather than a generic augmentation tool.

### **3.4.1 Preprocessing for Training the Improved TimeGAN+** {#3.4.1-preprocessing-for-training-the-improved-timegan+}

Before the Improved TimeGAN model can learn appliance-level electricity patterns from the smart-plug data, the preprocessed 10-minute power readings (from Section 3.3.2) must first be transformed into clean, normalized, and temporally consistent sequences. 

#### **A. Outlier Removal** {#a.-outlier-removal}

The first step ensures that all input values reflect realistic appliance-level electricity behavior. Although the readings have already passed the initial preprocessing pipeline, the dataset must undergo an additional layer of outlier removal tailored specifically for GAN training. The following criteria are applied:

1\. Physical Consistency Screening  
Each 10-minute record is checked against expected residential appliance operating limits:

* Voltage: 220–240 V  
* Current: \> 0 A and typically \< 15 A  
* Power: \> 0 W and typically \< 3000 W  
* Power factor: 0.85–1.00

Any reading that violates these bounds is removed. Table 3.19 shows a sample of a detected physical outlier.

| Timestamp | Power\_w |
| :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 14:50:00 | 4020 W |

*Table 3.19 Smart Plug Physical Outlier Data*  
	  
	This reading exceeds the appliance’s rated wattage and violates the established physical tolerance rules; it is not plausible for any device connected to a 16A smart plug and is therefore discarded.

2\. Sudden Spike Detection  
Even if a value is within physical limits, abrupt unrealistic jumps are removed, where a threshold τ is computed from historical variance. Readings with unrealistic jumps are removed using:  
![][image15]                              *Equation 3.18*  
	  
For example, consider the following preprocessed power values, in Table 3.20:

| Timestamp | Power (W) |
| :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 70.8 |
| 2025-10-17 08:10 | 71.5 |
| 2025-10-17 08:20 | 72.0 |
| 2025-10-17 08:30 | 185.0 |

*Table 3.20  Sample of Preprocessed Power Values*  
	  
For the monitored appliance, the expected change between consecutive intervals typically falls within 0.5 to 1.2 W, but the actual jump from 08:20 to 08:30, when evaluated using Equation 3.18,  
![][image16]  
exceeds the allowable threshold τ. Therefore, the 185 W reading is identified as a spike and removed from the dataset.

3\. Missing or Frozen Readings  
Although TimeGAN uses only the 10-minute power values as training input, the cumulative energy counter (kWh\_total) is used during preprocessing as a consistency indicator. Because kWh\_total must increase whenever an appliance is ON, any frozen or non-monotonic values signal a faulty interval. In such cases, interpolation is applied. Below, shown in Table 3.21, it illustrates examples of a frozen reading.

| Timestamp | Power\_w | kWh\_total |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10:00 | 70W | 0.152 |
| 10:10 | 71W | 0.152 |
| 10:20 | 73W | 0.161 |

*Table 3.21 Sample of Frozen Reading Records*  
	  
	Since kWh\_total must always increase when the appliance is ON, 10:10 cannot remain equal to 10:00. This will be fixed  using linear interpolation between the valid values at 10:00 and 10:20. For example,

| From 10:00 to 10:20, the total change is: 0.161-9.152=0.009kWh The number of 10-minute steps inside this interval: 10:00 \- 10:10 10:10 \- 10:20 So there are 2 segments, each segment increment is: \=0.0092=0.0045kWh Next, starting from 10:00 (0.152): 0.152+0.0045=0.1565 Thus, the corrected value at 10:10 becomes: 0.1565 kWh |
| :---- |

	The original frozen value of 0.152 kWh is replaced with the interpolated value of 0.1565 kWh, thereby restoring the expected monotonic progression of the cumulative energy counter. After fixing this inconsistency, power\_w will be recomputed. For example,

| If the corrected kWh\_total at 10:10 becomes: 0.1565 Then: ![][image17] Using the kWh difference computer earlier: ![][image18] \= 27 W |
| :---- |

	Thus, the recomputed power\_w at 10:10 becomes approximately consistent with neighboring interval values, replacing the unreliable value produced by the frozen counter.

#### **B. Min–Max Normalization** {#b.-min–max-normalization}

	Before TimeGAN training, each 10-minute power reading must be scaled into the range \[0,1\] using Min–Max Normalization:  
![][image19]                                   *Equation 3.19*  
Where:

* x \= original power value  
* xmin \= minimum power recorded in the two months  
* xmax \= maximum power recorded in the two months

For demonstration, consider the following preprocessed 10-minute power values from one appliance:

| Timestamp | Preprocessed Power (W) |
| :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 70.8 |
| 2025-10-17 08:10 | 71.5 |
| 2025-10-17 08:20 | 72.0 |

*Table 3.22 Sample of Preprocessed Power Values*

Assume that across the full two-month monitoring period, this appliance has:

* Minimum recorded power: xmin \= 12W  
* Maximum recorded power: xmax \= 810W

| For 70.8W: ![][image20] For 71.5W: ![][image21] For 72.0W ![][image22] |
| :---- |

	All 144 values of each day are transformed using the same Min–Max parameters (xmin,xmax). This normalization step ensures that the Improved TimeGAN learns the relative shape and temporal progression of daily appliance usage rather than absolute wattage magnitudes. Absolute values are restored later during the monthly scaling procedure using the participating household’s Meralco billing data. The table 3.23 illustrates the min-max normalization of the 10-minute power readings.

| Timestamp | Preprocessed Power (W) | Normalized Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 70.8 | 0.0736 |
| 2025-10-17 08:10 | 71.5 | 0.0746 |
| 2025-10-17 08:20 | 72.0 | 0.0752 |

*Table 3.23 Sample Min–Max Normalization of 10-Minute Power Readings*

#### **C. Daily Segmentation** {#c.-daily-segmentation}

	Once all power readings are normalized, the continuous 10-minute time series is segmented into daily windows, each representing one complete 24-hour cycle. For example:

| Given a 10-minute interval:  ![][image23] Let the normalized sequence be: ![][image24] where T is the total number of normalized 10-minute points in the two-month dataset. For each day d, we extract a window of 144 values: ![][image25] Thus, with approximately 60 days of real monitoring, N \= 60 daily sequences are obtained per monitored appliance |
| :---- |

Each sequence becomes one training sample for the Improved TimeGAN. The objective of this study is full-day appliance-level consumption reconstruction. Therefore, each sequence encodes morning ramp-up, mid-day stable periods, evening peaks, and night decline. This ensures the Improved TimeGAN learns the full temporal structure of daily load behavior.

| Timestamp | Normalized Power |
| :---- | :---- |
| 2025-10-17 00:00 | 0.1200 |
| 2025-10-17 00:10 | 0.1030 |
| 2025-10-17 00:20 | 0.0995 |
| … | … |
| 2025-10-17 08:00 | 0.0736 |
| 2025-10-17 08:10 | 0.0746 |
| 2025-10-17 08:20 | 0.0752 |
| … | … |
| 2025-10-17 23:50 | 0.2000 |

*Table 3.24 Example of a Daily Training Sequence*

	Shown in Table 3.24 is an example of a normalized daily training sequence derived from the smart-plug dataset. This table illustrates how all 10-minute normalized power readings for one full day are grouped into a single TimeGAN training example. Each row represents a 10-minute interval within a 24-hour period, resulting in 144 normalized values per day per appliance.

At this point, the Improved TimeGAN receives a clean, normalized, and temporally complete set of approximately sixty (60) daily sequences per monitored appliance. Each sample contains 144 time steps, corresponding to one full day of appliance-level electricity consumption.

### **3.4.2 Improved TimeGAN Architecture** {#3.4.2-improved-timegan-architecture}

	The generative model used in this study is based on the Improved TimeGAN architecture proposed by Tang et al. (2025). Its structure, shown in Figure 3.3, combines adversarial learning and supervised temporal modeling to generate synthetic time-series data that preserve both statistical similarity and sequential dynamics of real household daily load curves.  
![][image26]  
*Figure 3.3 The structure of the TimeGAN model*

The overall structure (Figure 3.3) integrates five interacting neural modules—the Embedding, Recovery, Generator, Discriminator, and Supervisor networks. These components operate on shared latent representations called latent codes, enabling the model to capture both the shape of daily electricity consumption profiles and the temporal transitions between different periods of the day.

Forward Pass Overview

* Encoding Real SequencesEach normalized daily sequence (144 time steps) is first passed through an LSTM-based Embedding Network (E), which converts the real data into a compact latent representation.  
* Reconstruction  
  The latent code is then passed to the Recovery Network (R), which attempts to reconstruct the original sequence. The difference between the real and reconstructed sequences produces the reconstruction loss, which teaches the encoder–decoder pair to preserve temporal structure.  
* Generation of Synthetic Latent Codes  
  The Generator (G) receives random noise and produces synthetic latent codes designed to mimic the structure of real latent sequences.  
* Adversarial Classification  
  The Discriminator (D) attempts to distinguish real latent codes (from E) from synthetic ones (from G).This forms the unsupervised adversarial loss, encouraging synthetic sequences to resemble real ones.  
* Temporal Supervision:  
  The Supervisor (S) predicts the next latent step in a sequence. This produces the supervised temporal loss, ensuring that TimeGAN learns realistic day-to-day transitions and long-range temporal dependencies.

With these, the Improved TimeGAN learns both:

* statistical similarity of real household consumption  
* temporal continuity across the 144 points of each daily curve

#### **A. Components of the Improved TimeGAN** {#a.-components-of-the-improved-timegan}

	The Improved TimeGAN retains the five core modules but enhances the Recovery Network by integrating Multi-Head Self-Attention, as shown in Table 3.25.

| Component | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Embedding (E) | Converts real sequences into latent space using LSTM layers |
| Recovery (R) | Reconstructs time-series from latent codes using GRU layers enhanced with Multi-Head Self-Attention |
| Generator (G) | Produces synthetic latent codes from random noise using GRU layers |
| Discriminator (D) | Classifies real vs. generated latent codes using GRU layers |
| Supervisor (S) | Predicts latent transitions to enforce temporal continuity |

*Table 3.25 Components of the Improved TimeGAN*

#### **B. Multi-Head Self-Attention in the Recovery Module** {#b.-multi-head-self-attention-in-the-recovery-module}

	An improvement introduced by Tang et al. (2025), and retained in this study, is the integration of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) layer within the Recovery module. As illustrated in Figure 3.4, this mechanism allows the network to assign varying attention weights to different time steps when reconstructing each point in the sequence.   
![][image27]  
*Figure 3.4 The Structure of the Improved Recovery Module*

Mathematically, single-head attention is computed as:  
![][image28]         *Equation 3.20*  
	For multi-head attention:  
![][image29]   *Equation 3.21*  
	  
This attention layer strengthens the model’s ability to capture long-range temporal patterns, periodic household behaviors, and subtle correlations across different time-of-day segments. This is especially important for reconstructing 144-point daily curves, where dependencies may span many hours.

#### **C. Loss Functions** {#c.-loss-functions}

	Training the Improved TimeGAN involves three loss functions operating simultaneously:  
1\. Reconstruction Loss  
	Ensures the recovered sequence matches the original normalized day:  
![][image30]               *Equation 3.22*  
2\. Unsupervised Adversarial Loss  
	Encourages synthetic sequences to resemble real ones:  
![][image31] *Equation 3.23*  
3\. Supervised Temporal Loss  
	Forces the Generator to match real temporal transitions:  
![][image32]               *Equation 3.24*  
	  
These losses teach the model to generate sequences that are (1) statistically similar, (2) temporally smooth, realistic, and structurally consistent with real household electricity data.

#### **D. Training Hyperparameters** {#d.-training-hyperparameters}

The training hyperparameters adopted in this study are based on the configuration proposed by Tang et al. (2025), with adjustments to accommodate the smaller residential dataset composed of approximately 60 normalized daily sequences. Table 3.26 summarizes the final hyperparameter settings to be used for training the Improved TimeGAN model.

| Parameter | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| RNN units | 64 |
| Attention heads | 4 |
| Learning rate | 3x10\-5 |
| Batch size | 128 |
| Epochs | 800 |

*Table 3.26 Training Hyperparameters*

As shown in Table 3.26, the selected hyperparameters provide a balance between training stability and model expressiveness. The Improved TimeGAN uses 64 RNN units and four attention heads, with a learning rate of 3×10−5 to ensure stable convergence during training. The batch size was reduced from 256, as used in Tang et al. (2025), to 128 to better accommodate the smaller scale of the residential dataset while preventing overfitting. The model is trained for 800 epochs, which is sufficient to capture complex daily electricity patterns without introducing instability.

### **3.4.3 Generating Synthetic Days** {#3.4.3-generating-synthetic-days}

After the Improved TimeGAN has been fully trained on the 60 normalized daily sequences obtained from the two months of real smart-plug monitoring per monitored appliance, the next stage is to use the trained model to generate the missing daily profiles for the remaining months of the historical period. The goal is to construct a complete 14-month dataset at 10-minute resolution, even though only two months contain real appliance-level measurements.  
	  
	Since the dataset must span 14 total months, and only 2 months are real:  
14 months \- 2 months \= 12 synthetic months

	Given that each month contains 28–31 days, the Improved TimeGAN must generate approximately: 12(302)360-370 synthetic daily profiles depending on the number of days per month.

	Each synthetic day is a sequence of 144 normalized points, corresponding to 24 hours × 6 samples per hour (10-minute intervals).

TimeGAN generates these sequences by sampling from a learned latent distribution. For each missing day, the Generator receives a combination of (a) random latent noise and (b) optional conditioning information that guides generation toward realistic seasonal patterns. Improved TimeGAN produces one synthetic daily load curve through the following steps:

1\. Sample Latent Noise Vector (z)  
	A latent noise vector is drawn from a multivariate distribution:  
![][image33]                                      *Equation 3.25*  
	  
This noise introduces natural day-to-day variability, preventing repeated or identical synthetic days.

2\. Create a Condition Vector (c)  
	The model supports optional conditioning information, which can encode:

* weekday vs. weekend  
* approximate month or season  
* coarse-level appliance-level load tendency

This helps the GAN generate day-profiles appropriate for their target month.

3\. Pass z and c Into the Generator (G)  
The generation process can be expressed as:  
![][image34]                                       *Equation 3.26*  
where:

* z \= a latent noise vector that introduces natural variation between synthetic days  
* c \= a condition vector, which may encode weekday or weekend status, approximate season, broad consumption tendency for the month.

This conditional setup allows the Generator to resemble the participating household’s observed appliance-level behavior but also follow the high-level seasonal context of each month. 

4\. Supervisor Enforces Temporal Structure  
	The Supervisor predicts next-step latent transitions, ensuring:

* smooth curves  
* realistic 144-step daily progression

5\. Recovery Network Reconstructs a Daily Load Curve  
![][image35]                                              *Equation 3.27*  
	This produces the 144-point normalized synthetic daily sequence, which has the same structure as the real normalized daily sequences used for training.

6\. Repeat for All Missing Days  
The process repeats until synthetic profiles for all missing 12 months have been generated, resulting in:  
*![][image36]         Equation 3.28*  
These are combined with the 60 real days per monitored appliance to form:  
*![][image37]        Equation 3.29*

This becomes the full high-resolution dataset for each monitored appliancet needed for scaling, appliance decomposition, and SARIMAX forecasting.

#### **A. Number of Synthetic Days Generated** {#a.-number-of-synthetic-days-generated}

Since the household provided two months of real data:

* Total required months: 14  
* Real months: 2  
* Synthetic months: 12

Approximate number of synthetic days required:  
![][image38]         *Equation 3.30*  
Each generated day is a normalized 144-step sequence. This synthetic day count applies independently to each monitored appliance.

#### **B. Characteristics of Raw Synthetic Output** {#b.-characteristics-of-raw-synthetic-output}

	The raw synthetic output produced by the Generator exhibits certain characteristics. Specifically:

1\. Smoother Curves Compared to Real Data  
TimeGAN tends to produce sequences with reduced noise and fewer abrupt fluctuations. This behavior is expected and desirable because:

* GANs learn the underlying pattern, not sensor noise.  
* Noise from the physical device is not reproduced.

2\. Preservation of Daily Structure  
Even with smoother profiles, the synthetic curves still reflect morning rise in load, plateau or mid-day baseline, evening peak, and night-time decline to indicate a successful learning of household usage cycles.

3\. Natural Variation from Day to Day  
The random latent vector z causes the model to generate slightly different shapes each day, preventing unnatural repetition or “copy-pasted” daily curves.

4\. Seasonal Patterns Reintroduced During Later Scaling  
While TimeGAN learns general day-level shapes, it does not directly encode hotter-month consumption, cooler-month consumption, and seasonal appliance behavior. These patterns are reintroduced during the monthly rescaling stage, where each synthetic month is matched to the participating household’s actual Meralco energy consumption for that month, with scaling applied proportionally across appliances.

| Time | Synthetic Day 1 | Synthetic Day 2 | Synthetic Day 3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00:00 | 0.08 | 0.10 | 0.07 |
| 00:10 | 0.07 | 0.09 | 0.08 |
| … | … | … | … |
| 23:50 | 0.19 | 0.17 | 0.21 |

*Table 3.27 Example of Normalized Raw Synthetic Daily Output*

These values, shown in Table 3.27, represent the raw synthetic daily output generated by the Improved TimeGAN before any rescaling is applied. Actual dates are assigned sequentially during the synchronization stage to ensure continuity with the real two-month dataset

### **3.4.4 Monthly Energy Scaling Using Meralco Bills** {#3.4.4-monthly-energy-scaling-using-meralco-bills}

Once the Improved TimeGAN has generated the normalized synthetic daily profiles, the next step is to convert these normalized values into realistic appliance-level wattage and energy consumption, proportionally aligned with the participating household’s monthly electricity usage. TimeGAN provides only the shape of the daily load curves, not the absolute magnitude. Therefore, each synthetic month must be scaled so that the combined appliance-level energy aligns with the actual household monthly energy consumption reported in the Meralco bill.

This stage ensures that the reconstructed dataset reflects true energy usage rather than arbitrary GAN-generated magnitudes.

#### **A. Compute Synthetic Monthly Energy** {#a.-compute-synthetic-monthly-energy}

	For each synthetic day, the normalized 144-point load curve is first denormalized back into estimated wattage values. These wattage values are then converted to kWh using the 10-minute sampling interval.

1\. Denormalize the Synthetic Daily Curve  
	For each synthetic day (144 normalized points), denormalize using:  
*![][image39]               Equation 3.31*  
Where:

* xnorm \= TimeGAN output  
* xmin,xmax \= from the real 2-month dataset

This returns the data to watts (W). For example,

| From earlier, across the 2-month dataset, it was assumed: Xmin \= 12W Xmax \= 810W So: ![][image40] |
| :---- |

	This step is applied to the normalized synthetic values for Synthetic Day 1, as presented in Table 3.27.

| For 0.08 at 00:00: ![][image41] ![][image42] ![][image43] For 0.07 at 00:10 ![][image44] ![][image45] ![][image46] For 0.19 at 23:50 ![][image47] ![][image48] ![][image49] |
| :---- |

	As a result, the values shown in Table 3.28 represent the denormalized outputs produced after applying the inverse scaling procedure.

| Time | Normalized Power (Synthetic Day 1\) | Denormalized Power (W) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00:00 | 0.08 | 75.84 |
| 00:10 | 0.07 | 67.86 |
| … | … | … |
| 23:50 | 0.19 | 163.62 |

*Table 3.28 Example of Denormalizing a Synthetic Daily Sequence*

The normalized values come directly from the TimeGAN sample table, while the denormalized values are computed using the same xmin and xMax parameters applied during the Min–Max normalization stage.

2\. Convert Denormalized Watts to kWh  
	Each 10-minute interval corresponds to:  
![][image50]                                     *Equation 3.32*  
Thus:  
![][image51]                                          *Equation 3.33*  
The total energy for a synthetic day d is computed as:  
![][image52]                                  *Equation 3.34*  
	The raw synthetic monthly energy consumption is then:  
![][image52]                                     *Equation 3.35*

	Using the corresponding denormalized wattage values shown in Table 3.28, the next step computes the energy contribution of each 10-minute interval.

| At 00:00: P \= 75.84W ![][image53] At 00:10: P \= 67.86 W ![][image54] At 23:50: P \= 163.62W ![][image55] |
| :---- |

	After converting the denormalized power readings into their equivalent 10-minute kWh values, the resulting energy values are summarized in Table 3.29.

| Timestamp | Power (W) | kWh for 10 min |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00:00 | 75.84 | 0.01264 |
| 00:10 | 67.86 | 0.01131 |
| … | … | … |
| 23:50 | 163.62 | 0.02727 |

*Table 3.29 Example of Denormalized Power to kWh*

	After that, total energy is computed by adding all 144 10-minute kWh values.

| Assume that the full-day total comes to: ![][image56] |
| :---- |

	This represents the raw appliance-level synthetic energy total prior to household-level scaling.

3\. Compute Raw Synthetic Monthly Energy  
If a month has D days:  
![][image57]                                     *Equation 3.36*  
where D is the number of days in the month (28–31 depending on the month). This value is usually lower or higher than the real household consumption, because GANs learn the shape but not the absolute consumption.

	For example:

| If the synthetic month has 31 days: ![][image58] This is the raw monthly synthetic energy before scaling. |
| :---- |

#### **B. Compute the Scaling Factor** {#b.-compute-the-scaling-factor}

Before computing the scaling factor, it is important to clarify that the Meralco bill reflects the entire household’s monthly electricity consumption, while the study monitors only three selected appliances. To contextualize this difference, the monitored portion of the household’s total monthly energy is estimated for each of the two months where real smart-plug and Meralco data overlap. For each month m,  
*![][image59]     Equation 3.37*

![][image60]                        *Equation 3.38*

The monthly coverage ratio is then computed as:  
![][image61]                           *Equation 3.39*

This provides a month-by-month indication of how much of the household’s energy is represented by the monitored subset. The study reports both month-specific coverage and the overall average across the two months. This percentage is used only as contextual information; the Meralco scaling factor is derived from household-level totals but applied proportionally to the appliance-level synthetic data, because the Improved TimeGAN generates appliance-level load curves, while the Meralco bill reflects total household consumption.

The Meralco bill provides the actual monthly energy consumption in kWh. Let:

* EMeralco \= actual monthly energy in kWh  
* Eraw \= raw GAN total for that same month

The scaling factor α is computed as:  
![][image62]                                    *Equation 40*  
	  
This factor indicates how much the appliance-level synthetic month must be expanded or reduced so that the combined energy matches the household’s actual energy usage. If α \> 1, the raw synthetic month is too low and must be scaled upward; if α \< 1, the raw synthetic month is too high and must be scaled downward.

	For example:

| For the month of March, the household’s Meralco bill reports: ![][image63] The Improved TimeGAN produces a raw synthetic monthly total of:  ![][image64] Then: ![][image65] ![][image66] |
| :---- |

	Thus, the synthetic month is 19.7% lower than the true consumption, and must be scaled upward by multiplying every 10-minute wattage value by 1.197.

#### **C. Apply Scaling to the Synthetic Month** {#c.-apply-scaling-to-the-synthetic-month}

All appliance-level wattage values in the synthetic month are rescaled:  
![][image67]                                      *Equation 41*  
This ensures that:  
![][image68]                            *Equation 42*  
This preserves the shape, determined by the GAN, and the size (magnitude), determined by real Meralco kWh. The result is a synthetic month that accurately reflects both daily behavioral patterns and true household energy consumption.

| Month | Meralco kWh | Raw GAN kWh | α | Final kWh |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| March | 225 | 188 | 1.197 | 225 |
| April | 240 | 262 | 0.916 | 240 |

*Table 3.30. Example of Synthetic Month Scaling*

	As illustrated in Table 3.30, the monthly scaling procedure corrects discrepancies between the raw synthetic output and the actual Meralco billing data. 

| For March, the synthetic month underestimated consumption at 188 kWh Scaling factor:  ![][image69], which is an upward adjustment of approximately 19.7% to match the true household usage of 225 kWh. In contrast, the April synthetic output slightly overestimated consumption at 262 kWh Scaling factor: ![][image70] This requires the values to be scaled downward by about 8.4% using a factor of 0.916. |
| :---- |

After scaling, the combined appliance-level synthetic energy for each month perfectly matches the household’s true energy consumption, correcting the natural magnitude limitations of GAN outputs.

#### **D. Scaling Applied to 10-Minute Interval Values** {#d.-scaling-applied-to-10-minute-interval-values}

	Once the monthly scaling factor α has been computed, it is applied directly to every 10-minute wattage value generated by TimeGAN. This step is essential because the Improved TimeGAN produces daily sequences at fixed 10-minute resolution (144 points per day). The structure of these sequences must remain intact throughout scaling.

The scaled wattage for each interval t is computed as:  
![][image71]                                          *Equation 3.43* 

* Synthetic Day 1 → 144 points × α  
* Synthetic Day 2 → 144 points × α  
* Synthetic Day 3 → 144 points × α  
* …  
* Synthetic Day D → 144 points × α

where D is the number of days in the synthetic month (28–31).

	To illustrate how the scaling factor α is applied to each 10-minute interval, consider the month of March, in Table 3.30, where:

* EMeralco \= 225 kWh  
* Eraw \= 188 kWh

| Thus: ![][image72] Assume that for one synthetic day in March, the raw denormalized wattage at 08:00 is: ![][image73] The scaled wattage for this interval is computed as: ![][image74] Substituting: ![][image75] ![][image76] Rounded: ![][image77] |
| :---- |

	Shown in Table 3.31 is raw synthetic wattage of 82.5 W becomes 98.7 W after applying the monthly scaling factor for March.

| Timestamp | Raw Synthetic Power (W) | Scaling Factor α | Scaled Power (W) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-03-05 08:00 | 82.5 | 1.197 | 98.7 |

*Table 3.31 Example of Interval-Level Scaling*  
	  
This interval-level computation is applied to all 144 points of each synthetic day within the month. After scaling every interval, the total monthly energy automatically equals the Meralco-recorded value (225 kWh for March), while the original TimeGAN shape remains intact. This ensures that every individual 10-minute interval is scaled proportionally, adjusting only magnitude while preserving the temporal pattern generated by the GAN. Importantly, the procedure does not scale daily totals or monthly totals directly; instead, the totals adjust automatically after interval-wise scaling.

#### **E. Preservation of 10-Minute Structure After Scaling** {#e.-preservation-of-10-minute-structure-after-scaling}

After the scaling factor has been applied, the 10-minute temporal resolution remains unchanged. Only the wattage values are modified, not the number of intervals.

* Before scaling:  
   ![][image78]  
* After scaling:  
  ![][image79]


	Thus, all timestamps remain unchanged, and the daily load shapes produced by the model are preserved. Only the magnitudes of the synthetic values are adjusted proportionally to match the participating household’s actual monthly consumption. As a result, the final scaled dataset maintains the original temporal structure while ensuring that each month’s total aligns exactly with the corresponding Meralco billing record.

### **3.4.5 Appliance-Level Reconstruction** {#3.4.5-appliance-level-reconstruction}

After generating and scaling the synthetic daily load profiles for all missing months, the final step is to convert the aggregated synthetic load curve into per-appliance synthetic energy curves. This step is necessary because:

* The Improved TimeGAN was trained on the aggregated monitored load, and  
* The forecasting framework requires appliance-level time series, consistent with the actual smart-plug data structure.

Thus, the GAN produces synthetic data representing the total monitored subset, and this total must be decomposed back into separate appliance curves.

#### **A. Computing Real Appliance Energy Shares** {#a.-computing-real-appliance-energy-shares}

	The disaggregation process begins by analyzing the real 2-month smart-plug dataset. For each monitored appliance a, the total energy consumption is computed and compared to the total aggregated monitored load. Let:  
![][image80]  
*Equation 3.44*  
![][image81]                                       *Equation 3.45*

	The appliance’s share is then computed as:  
![][image82]                                        *Equation 3.46*  
where:

* Ea \= total energy consumed by appliance a during the real two-month period  
* Etotal \= total household energy during the same period

These shares reflect the real usage proportions found during monitoring. They serve as weighting factors for allocating the synthetic aggregated load.

#### **B. Allocating the Synthetic Aggregated Load to Appliances** {#b.-allocating-the-synthetic-aggregated-load-to-appliances}

Once a synthetic day has been generated and scaled using the Meralco-based energy adjustment (Section 3.4.4), the resulting curve represents:

* a 144-point, 10-minute synthetic load sequence  
* for the combined monitored appliances

	To recover appliance-specific synthetic sequences, each 10-minute synthetic power value Pt is multiplied by the appliance’s share:  
*![][image83]                                   Equation 3.47*  
	This computation is applied across all appliances, for all 144 ten-minute intervals per day, and for all synthetic days within the twelve reconstructed months. This guarantees that every synthetic data point is preserved, appliance-level patterns remain proportionally realistic based on their measured energy shares, and that the reconstructed appliance curves collectively sum back to the scaled synthetic household load for each interval.

An example of this proportional decomposition for a single synthetic day is shown in Table 3.31.

| Time | Total | Ref 30% | Fan 10% | Others 60% |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 08:00 | 400 | 120 | 40 | 240 |
| 20:00 | 550 | 165 | 55 | 330 |

*Table 3.31 Sample Appliance-Level Decomposition for a Synthetic Day*

	For example:

| Suppose the GAN-generated and scaled synthetic value at 08:00 is: ![][image84] If two-month monitoring found: Refrigerator \= 30% Electric Fan \= 10% Other monitored appliance \= 60% Then, for ref at 30% 0.30 x 400 \= 120W For Fan at 10% 0.10 x 400 \= 40W For Others at 60% 0.60 x 400 \= 240W |
| :---- |

	  
	At every time interval t:  
*![][image85]                                      Equation 3.48*

The same proportional allocation is applied at every 10-minute interval throughout the synthetic day. After proportional allocation, the process yields three synthetic appliance-level datasets, each covering the full 14-month period at the original 10-minute resolution (144 points per day). These reconstructed sequences match the structure of the real smart-plug logs, providing complete, appliance-specific time series that are rready for individual appliance-level SARIMAX model training.

#### **C. Aggregating the Appliance-Level Synthetic kWh to Hourly Resolution** {#c.-aggregating-the-appliance-level-synthetic-kwh-to-hourly-resolution}

	Before SARIMAX forecasting, the reconstructed 10-minute appliance-level synthetic data must be aggregated to hourly resolution, so that other variables align correctly. Each hour consists of six 10-minute intervals, therefore:

1\. Hourly Energy Calculation  
For appliance a in hour h:  
*![][image86]                              Equation 3.49*  
	Where each 10-minute interval contributes:  
*![][image87]                                  Equation 3.50*

### **3.4.6 Post-Generation Validation** {#3.4.6-post-generation-validation}

After generating and scaling the synthetic daily profiles, the final step is to verify that the reconstructed dataset preserves the statistical and temporal characteristics of the participating household’s real appliance-level electricity data. If the GAN-generated data deviates too far from the real appliance-level distribution, it may introduce bias into the forecasting model or distort seasonal trends.

To ensure the quality of the synthetic dataset, this study replicates the validation procedures used by Tang et al. (2025), which include three classes of evaluation: statistical comparison, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

#### **A. Denormalization of Synthetic Data** {#a.-denormalization-of-synthetic-data}

	Before any comparison can be made, the normalized synthetic daily sequences are converted back into their original physical units (watts and kilowatt-hours). This is performed using the inverse of the min–max scaling applied during preprocessing:  
*![][image88]                   Equation 3.51*  
	Denormalization ensures that all validation procedures reflect realistic energy values and can be directly compared against real smart-plug measurements.

#### **B. Statistical Comparison** {#b.-statistical-comparison}

Once denormalized, both the real and synthetic datasets undergo a statistical comparison across the following metrics:

* Mean (Central Tendency)  
  The average energy level across the day:  
  *![][image89]                              Equation 3.52*  
* Standard deviation (Dispersion)  
  The variability or dispersion:  
  *![][image90]                               Equation 3.53*  
* Quartiles (Q1, Median, Q3)  
  The distribution shape and depth. Quartiles are computed from the empirical distribution of values within each daily sequence and provide a robust measure of distribution depth and symmetry.  
* Skewness (Distribution Asymmetry)  
  The asymmetry in consumption patterns. Using the adjusted Fisher–Pearson coefficient:  
  *![][image91]             Equation 3.54*  
* Kurtosis  
  Tail heaviness or peak sharpness. The closer synthetic kurtosis is to real kurtosis, the more faithfully the GAN captures rare peaks and tail behavior.  
  ![][image92]*Equation 3.55*

These statistics are computed for every daily sequence and then summarized into comparative tables. The expectation is that synthetic data should maintain a mean error below 0.5%, quartile differences within 0.5%, variance errors under 10%, and skewness and kurtosis values that closely match those of the real dataset. In this study, the same tolerance thresholds are applied. Synthetic daily curves that fall within these ranges are regarded as statistically consistent with the participating household’s observed appliance-level load patterns, indicating that the Improved TimeGAN has successfully captured both the distributional properties and the natural variability present in the real smart-plug data.

#### **C. PCA Visualization** {#c.-pca-visualization}

	To evaluate similarity in structural patterns, both real and synthetic sequences are projected into a lower-dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA condenses the 144 time-step daily sequence into a few comprehensive components while preserving the major variance directions. If the Improved TimeGAN has successfully learned the underlying daily load dynamics, the PCA scatter plot should show:

* overlapping clusters of real and synthetic days  
* similar spread, density, and orientation

Such alignment indicates that the synthetic days exhibit comparable structure to the participating household’s real appliance-level electricity patterns. PCA is performed by:  
1\. Standardizing each sequence.  
2\. Computing the covariance matrix  
![][image93]                                      *Equation 3.56*  
3.Performing eigenvalue decomposition to extract principal components.  
	  
	Because PCA preserves directions of maximum variance, overlapping clusters of real and synthetic points in the 2-D PCA plot indicate that the synthetic data capture the major temporal patterns (morning rise, midday plateau, evening peak) present in real household usage.

#### **D. t-SNE Visualization** {#d.-t-sne-visualization}

While PCA captures linear relationships, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) evaluates non-linear similarity. This method projects the sequences into a 2-dimensional manifold that highlights local neighborhood relationships. In a successful validation:

* synthetic points intermix naturally with real points  
* no obvious isolated synthetic clusters appear  
* local shapes and groupings remain preserved

1\. High-dimensional similarity (Gaussian kernel)  
For each pair of real data points xi, xj:  
*![][image94]                Equation 3.57*  
2\. Low-dimensional similarity (Student t-distribution)  
*![][image95]                     Equation 3.58*  
3\. Optimization objective (KL divergence)  
	t-SNE finds low-dimensional representations by minimizing:  
![][image96]               *Equation 3.59*

If real and synthetic daily profiles form intermixed clusters with similar density and shape in t-SNE space, this indicates that the GAN has correctly learned both the local and global geometric structure of the participating household’s appliance-level daily usage patterns. Only when all three validations indicate acceptable alignment does the appliance-level dataset proceed to SARIMAX model training.

#### **E. Synchronization of Real, Synthetic, and Weather Datasets** {#e.-synchronization-of-real,-synthetic,-and-weather-datasets}

	The final step is the synchronization of all components into a single continuous 14-month time series. This unified dataset contains:

* Two months of real, preprocessed appliance-level 10-minute measurements per monitored appliance, and  
* Twelve months of scaled, per-appliance synthetic profiles generated and adjusted using the Improved TimeGAN.

Synchronizing Real (2-Month) and Synthetic (12-Month) Data  
1\. Identify the final timestamp of the real dataset  
For the participating household, the last valid timestamp of the real preprocessed data is determined. For example, the final datapoint is 2025-03-01 23:50. This marks the boundary between real and synthetic portions.

2\. Assign dates to synthetic days  
	Each synthetic daily sequence contains 144 points (10-minute intervals).  
Synthetic Day 1 is assigned to the calendar day immediately after the last real observation. For example, in Table 3.32:

| Synthetic Day | Assigned Date | Time Range |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Day 1 | 2025-03-02 | 00:00 → 23:50 |
| Day 2 | 2025-03-03 | 00:00 → 23:50 |
| Day 3 | 2025-03-04 | 00:00 → 23:50 |
| … | … | … |
| Day 31 | 2025-04-01 | 00:00 → 23:50 |

*Table 3.32 Assignment of Dates*

This continues until all synthetic days (≈ 360–370) are mapped to concrete calendar dates, filling the remaining 12-month gap.

3\. Ensure full 14-month continuity  
	Because the real dataset covers \~60 days and the target is 14 months (≈ 425 days), synthetic timestamps are assigned sequentially without gaps until the final required calendar day is reached.

This produces:

* A single continuous timeline  
* No missing days  
* No timestamp collisions  
* 144 consistent rows per day

Integration of Weather Data  
	Weather variables (temperature, humidity, rainfall) were collected hourly via API. Since TimeGAN data is at 10-minute resolution, synchronization follows:

1\. Real 2-month segment

* Appliance data (10 min) is aggregated to hourly  
* Weather data directly matches each hourly timestamp

2\. Synthetic 12-month segment

* Synthetic appliance curves are aggregated to hourly (mean of 6×10-min intervals)  
* These hourly points are joined with the weather API’s hourly timestamps

	After synchronization and weather alignment, each appliance has:  
Per Appliance

* 14 months × \~30.4 days per month × 144 points per day ≈ 61,200 rows (10-minute)  
* Hourly aggregated version: 14 months × \~30.4 days × 24 hours ≈ 10,200 hourly rows

For the Three Monitored Appliances

* \~61,200 × 3 \= 183,600 10-minute records  
* \~10,200 × 3 \= 30,600 hourly records

Total Duration

* \~425 calendar days  
* \~10,200 hours

| Timestamp | Appliance\_ID | Hourly\_kWh | Temp\_C | Humidity\_% | Rain\_mm | is\_real |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025-01-15 08:00 | H1\_Fan | 0.0698 | 28.4 | 65 | 0.0 | 1 |
| 2025-01-15 09:00 | H1\_Fan | 0.0720 | 29.1 | 63 | 0.0 | 1 |
| … | … | … | … | … | … | … |
| 2025-03-02 00:00 | H1\_Fan | 0.0837 | 27.0 | 72 | 0.1 | 0 |
| 2025-03-02 01:00 | H1\_Fan | 0.0792 | 26.4 | 74 | 0.0 | 0 |

*Table 3.33 Sample of the Final Integrated Hourly Dataset*

A sample portion of the final synchronized dataset, combining the real 10-minute observations, the twelve months of synthetic appliance-level values per monitored appliance, and the aligned hourly weather variables, is presented in Table 3.33. The appliance\_id column is included in the final dataset only as a label used to organize and filter the data.

## **3.5 Modeling Approach** {#3.5-modeling-approach}

	This section outlines the end-to-end pipeline for forecasting hourly appliance-level electricity consumption for each monitored appliance. The approach builds on the validated appliance-level dataset (Table 3.33) and covers pre-modeling checks, SARIMAX model estimation, baseline performance evaluation, diagnostic validation, and error analysis.

### **3.5.1 Pre-Modeling Checks** {#3.5.1-pre-modeling-checks}

#### **A. Stationarity Assessment** {#a.-stationarity-assessment}

	SARIMAX models assume a stationary time series. Stationarity was verified using the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test, which checks whether the mean and variance of Yt remain constant over time. The ADF test essentially tests whether the time series has a unit root, which would make it non-stationary. The ADF test is based on the following regression equation:  
*Yt=+t+Yt-1+1Yt-1+2Yt-2+...+pYt-p+t     Equation 3.60*  
Where:

* Yt=Yt-Yt-1 is the change in energy consumption at time t  
* Yt-1 is the lagged value of the original series,  
*  is the constant (intercept),  
* t is a trend term (if the model includes a trend),  
*  is the coefficient of the lagged value Yt-1, indicating the presence of a unit root (non-stationarity),  
* 1, ..., p are the coefficients for the lagged differences (to account for serial correlation),  
* t is the random error (white noise).

For Test Statistic, the ADF test statistic is computed as:  
ADF=SE(Y)                                        *Equation 3.61*  
Where:

*  is the estimated coefficient for Yt-1  
* SE() is the standard error of 

Interpretation:

* Null Hypothesis H0: The series has a unit root  
* Alternative Hypothesis HA: The series is stationary

	If the p-value from the ADF test is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the series is stationary. Otherwise, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the series is non-stationary. If the series is non-stationary, we apply differencing to induce stationarity. This could involve:

* First differencing (subtracting each observation from the previous one) or,  
* Seasonal differencing (subtracting the observation from the value 24 hours earlier).

	For example, for an appliance’s hourly series, if the ADF test yields ADF=-4.12 and p=0.01, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the series is stationary, no further differencing is required. However, if p=0.26, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and apply differencing to make the series stationary.

**B. Seasonality Detection and Adjustment**  
After confirming stationarity, the next step is to detect seasonality. Seasonal patterns in energy consumption are often periodic, typically on a daily cycle (e.g., 24-hour periodicity). To detect these seasonal patterns, we use the Autocorrelation Function (ACF), which helps identify the lag at which the series repeats. If the series exhibits daily seasonality, the ACF will show a peak at lag 24 (representing a 24-hour cycle).

1. Initial Seasonality Detection

The SARIMAX model is first applied to detect the seasonal period, which is typically set to 24 hours for daily cycles. The seasonal component is identified based on the observed pattern in the ACF plot, which will show periodic peaks at the seasonal period (lag 24 for daily seasonality). This serves as the initial estimate for the seasonal period in the SARIMAX model.

2. Seasonal Parameter Selection and Refinement

Once the initial seasonality has been detected, the seasonal parameters (AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) components) and seasonal differencing are systematically refined through model identification procedures. This involves analyzing both the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine appropriate seasonal orders.

The seasonal parameter selection follows these steps:

* Seasonal Differencing (D): Applied to remove seasonal trends. The number of seasonal differences is determined by examining whether the seasonal pattern persists after differencing.  
* Seasonal AR Order (P): Identified by examining the PACF plot at seasonal lags (multiples of 24). Significant spikes at these lags indicate the appropriate seasonal AR order.  
* Seasonal MA Order (Q): Identified by examining the ACF plot at seasonal lags. Significant spikes at these lags indicate the appropriate seasonal MA order.  
* Multiple candidate models with different combinations of seasonal parameters are estimated and compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The model with the lowest AIC/BIC values, while maintaining statistically significant coefficients and satisfying diagnostic checks, is selected as the optimal specification.

Performance is evaluated using forecasting accuracy metrics including Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The selected seasonal parameters ensure that the model accurately captures the periodic patterns in energy consumption while maintaining parsimony and interpretability.

### **3.5.2 Model Estimation and Fitting** {#3.5.2-model-estimation-and-fitting}

	This subsection describes the formulation and estimation of the forecasting model used to predict hourly appliance-level energy consumption. The model selected for this study is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX), which extends the standard ARIMA framework by incorporating both seasonality and external explanatory variables (exogenous regressors).

#### **A. SARIMAX Model Structure** {#a.-sarimax-model-structure}

	The SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) model is an extension of the ARIMA model, which incorporates both seasonal and non-seasonal components. This makes it ideal for time series forecasting, especially when patterns such as seasonality (e.g., daily or weekly cycles) are present in the data.

A SARIMAX model is written as SARIMAX (p, d, q) (P, D, Q)s where: 

* p is the order of the AR term.   
* d is the order of differencing needed to make the data stationary.   
* q is the order of the MA term.   
* P is the order of the seasonal AR term.   
* D is the order of the seasonal differencing needed to make data stationary.   
* Q is the order of the seasonal MA term.   
* S is the number of periods in a season.

	A SARIMAX (p, d, q) (P, D, Q)s is mathematically represented as:  
![][image97] *Equation 3.62*  
Where

* Yt is the observed energy consumption at time t  
* 1 is the autoregressive (AR) term, which accounts for the relationship between the current value and its previous value Yt-1  
* 1 is the moving average (MA) term, which represents the influence of past forecast errors t-1 on the current value.  
* 1 is the coefficient of the exogenous variables (Xt), such as weather (temperature, humidity) and time-related features (hour of day, day of week, weekend flag, holiday flag, etc.), which help to explain variations in energy consumption beyond the historical values of Yt  
* The seasonal components (AR, MA, differencing) are selected based on the specific seasonal patterns observed in the data (e.g., daily seasonality) using systematic model identification procedures.

This formulation allows the SARIMAX model to handle both short-term (non-seasonal) dependencies, as well as long-term seasonal cycles. It also incorporates external factors, making it more flexible and suitable for forecasting energy consumption, where external variables such as weather conditions and time of day have a significant influence.

1\. Autoregressive (AR) Component:  
	The AR part captures the serial correlation between the current value and the lagged values in the time series. The model’s order p indicates how many lagged terms are included.  
2\. Moving Average (MA) Component:  
	The MA component models the relationship between the current value and the residual errors from the previous time steps. The order q defines how many past forecast errors are considered in the model.  
3\. Seasonal Components:  
	The seasonal components allow the model to capture periodic patterns in the data. The seasonal orders (P,D,Q) correspond to the seasonal AR, differencing, and MA terms, respectively. These components are identified through systematic analysis of ACF and PACF plots and refined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to optimize forecasting performance.  
4\. Exogenous Variables  
The exogenous variables are external factors that can influence energy consumption. In the SARIMAX model, these variables (such as temperature, humidity, or day of the week) are incorporated to help explain the variations in energy consumption that cannot be explained by the historical values of Yt  alone. 

The SARIMAX model, therefore, combines these components to generate forecasts that account for both time-based dependencies (AR, MA), external factors (X\_t), and seasonal patterns (seasonal AR, MA), all of which are essential for accurate energy consumption forecasting.

#### **B. Model Identification and Parameter Selection** {#b.-model-identification-and-parameter-selection}

	In time series modeling, the AR (AutoRegressive) and MA (Moving Average) orders, along with the seasonal components, are critical for determining the model structure. The process of selecting these orders involves using Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to analyze the time series data and determine the appropriate values for p, d, q (non-seasonal components) and P, D, Q (seasonal components).

1\. ACF and PACF Plots

* ACF Plot: Shows the correlation of the time series with its own lagged values. The significant spikes in the ACF indicate the MA (Moving Average) order q.  
* PACF Plot: Shows the partial correlation between the series and its lagged values after removing the effect of earlier lags. The significant spikes in the PACF indicate the AR (AutoRegressive) order p.

	The seasonal period is set to 24 hours (for daily cycles), as determined from the previous seasonality detection step. This ensures that the model can capture the periodic fluctuations in energy consumption.

2\. Refining Model Orders Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)  
After identifying the initial AR and MA orders from the ACF and PACF plots, the model orders (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q) are further refined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC helps balance the model's fit (likelihood) and its complexity (number of parameters), selecting the model that best explains the data without overfitting.  
	  
The AIC is calculated using the formula:  
AIC=2k-2log(L)                            *Equation 3.63*  
where:

* 𝑘 is the number of estimated parameters in the model (including AR and MA terms, seasonal terms, and exogenous variables).  
* 𝐿 is the maximized value of the likelihood function, which measures how well the model fits the data.

3\. Model Selection  
	The optimal model is chosen by minimizing the AIC value. A lower AIC indicates a better model, as it suggests a better trade-off between model fit and complexity. The model with the lowest AIC is selected as the final model for forecasting energy consumption.

	The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) is used to identify the order of the AutoRegressive (AR) process in a time series model. Unlike the ACF, which shows the correlation between the time series and its lagged values, the PACF shows the correlation between the time series and its lagged values after removing the effect of intervening lags.

4\. PACF Formula  
The PACF is computed as the correlation between the residuals of the autoregressive process up to a certain lag. The formula for the PACF at lag k is:  
![][image98] *Equation 3.64*  
Where:

* kk is the partial autocorrelation at lag 𝑘,  
* Yt is the observed value at time t,  
* Cov denotes the covariance between the current value and the lagged value, after accounting for the influence of all the intermediate lags.  
* Var represents the variance of the residuals after removing the effects of intervening lags.

	The PACF can be calculated recursively, typically using methods such as the Durbin-Levinson algorithm, which computes the coefficients for AR processes. It is interpreted using the following:

* The PACF plot displays the partial autocorrelation coefficients for various lags.  
* Significant spikes in the PACF plot indicate the appropriate order of the AR process  
* If a spike is observed at lag p and subsequent spikes are not significant, then the AR order p is chosen as p.

#### **C. Exogenous Variables and Feature Vector** {#c.-exogenous-variables-and-feature-vector}

In the SARIMAX model, exogenous variables are external factors that can influence the time series, but are not part of the series itself. These variables can include factors like weather data, time-related features, and other external variables that help explain variations in energy consumption beyond the historical values of the series. For example, the exogenous feature vector Xt for each record may look like this:  
Xt \= \[temperaturet, humidityt, rainfallt, hour\_of\_dayt, day\_of\_weekt, is\_weekendt, is\_holidayt, lag\_24t, lag\_168t, rolling\_mean\_24t, rolling\_mean\_168t\] and the target variable is Yt \= kWht

To ensure meaningful interpretation and proper model estimation, each of the exogenous variables is standardized to its native units.

Feature Vector Integration with SARIMAX  
Once standardized, the exogenous feature vector Xt is used in the SARIMAX model formulation as part of the model's inputs. The inclusion of these exogenous variables helps the model account for external factors influencing the target variable and provides more accurate forecasts.  
![][image99]*Equation 3.65*  
Where:

* Xt represents the exogenous feature vector,  
* 1 is the coefficient for the exogenous variables, showing the impact of each feature on energy consumption.

#### **D. Forecast Horizon and Rolling-Origin Strategy** {#d.-forecast-horizon-and-rolling-origin-strategy}

The model evaluation is performed using a rolling-origin evaluation strategy. This approach ensures that each forecast is based solely on past data, mimicking real-world forecasting conditions where only historical data is available at the time of making predictions.

At each forecast origin t, the model is retrained using all available data, and it generates 24-hour ahead predictions for the next time step. This is repeated for every time step in the testing set, ensuring the model forecasts for unseen data and maintains the integrity of temporal dependencies.

Mathematically, the forecast at time t for h-steps ahead is:  
Yt+h|t=f(Y1,Y2, ..., Yt)                               *Equation 3.66*  
Where:

* Yt+h|t is the forecasted value for time t+h  
* f() represents the SARIMAX forecasting function, which is trained on the data up to time t.

This rolling-origin strategy means that at each forecast origin t, the model:

* Retrains on the data available up to time t,  
* Produces 24-hour-ahead predictions for each subsequent time step.

This process ensures that the model forecasts using only historical data, making the evaluation realistic and suitable for real-world deployment.

#### **E. Data Splitting and Evaluation Window** {#e.-data-splitting-and-evaluation-window}

	To ensure that temporal dependencies are preserved and that model evaluation reflects real forecasting conditions, the dataset was divided using a chronological (time-ordered) split rather than random sampling. This ensures that future information does not influence the model's training process.

A total of continuous hourly observations were available for each monitored appliance, representing the appliance's energy consumption and corresponding environmental variables. To split the data, we followed the established time-series forecasting practices, which allocate:

* 80% of the earliest observations for the training set  
* 20% of the most recent observations for the testing set

This chronological 80–20 split ensures that:

* The training segment covers at least one full annual cycle, allowing the model to learn seasonal, weekly, and daily usage patterns effectively and captures multiple daily and weekly seasonal cycles (24-hour and 168-hour patterns), enabling the model to learn from these recurring patterns,  
* The testing segment provides unseen data for model evaluation, ensuring that the model's performance is assessed on data it has never seen during training.

Mathematically, the split is represented as:

![][image100]            *Equation 3.67*  
![][image101]           *Equation 3.68*

Where:

* Yt represents the data points (energy consumption and environmental variables) at time t  
* n is the total number of data points in the dataset.

1\. Rolling-Origin Evaluation Within the Testing Window  
	Within the testing window, a rolling-origin evaluation strategy was applied. The forecast origin moves incrementally through time, producing sequential 24-hour-ahead predictions. For each new forecast, the model is retrained using all available data up to the current origin. For example:

* First Forecast: The model forecasts 24 hours ahead, starting from the earliest point in the testing set.  
* Second Forecast: The forecast origin moves forward by one time step, and the model is retrained to produce a new 24-hour-ahead prediction.

This process is repeated for each time step in the testing set, ensuring that each forecast is based on past data.

### **3.5.3 Model Evaluation and Error Analysis** {#3.5.3-model-evaluation-and-error-analysis}

This section explains how the developed SARIMAX forecasting model is evaluated and validated to ensure predictive accuracy, stability, and reliability.

#### **A. Evaluation Design and Performance Metrics** {#a.-evaluation-design-and-performance-metrics}

	Model evaluation is crucial for assessing the predictive accuracy and overall performance of the SARIMAX model. Several error metrics are used to evaluate the model’s performance and quantify how well it forecasts energy consumption. These include:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors in the forecast, without considering their direction. It is calculated as:

MAE=1nt=1nYt-Yt                                  *Equation 3.69*

* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors, making it sensitive to outliers. It is calculated as:

RMSE=1nt=1n(Yt-Yt)2                           *Equation 3.70*

* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): This metric expresses forecast accuracy as a percentage of the difference between the actual and predicted values. It is particularly useful when comparing performance across datasets with different scales. It is calculated as:

MAPE=1nt=1nYt-YtYt  100%                        *Equation 3.71*

* R2 (Coefficient of Determination): This measures how well the predictions approximate the actual data points. It provides an indication of how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model. It is calculated as:

R2=1-t=1n(Yt-Yt)2t=1n(Yt-Yt)2                                   *Equation 3.72*  
	  
These error metrics allow the model to be compared with baseline models for each monitored appliance to quantify the improvements brought by dynamic seasonality adjustments. For example, if the SARIMAX model with dynamic seasonality adjustments outperforms a Seasonal Naïve model (which assumes the forecast is simply the previous period's value), it would indicate that incorporating seasonal adjustments provides better forecasting performance.

#### **B. Residual Diagnostics and Model Validation** {#b.-residual-diagnostics-and-model-validation}

After fitting each appliance-level SARIMAX model, it is crucial to analyze the residuals (the errors between the predicted values and the actual observed values). This step ensures that the model has properly captured the underlying patterns in the data and that no information remains in the residuals that could further improve the model.

The residuals are analyzed to verify that they resemble white noise, meaning:

* They are uncorrelated (no systematic pattern),  
* They are normally distributed (errors should have a bell-shaped distribution),  
* They have constant variance (homoscedasticity).

The following diagnostic techniques are used to validate the residuals:  
1\. Autocorrelation Function (ACF): The ACF plot of the residuals should show no significant correlations at any lags if the model has adequately captured the dependencies in the data. If the residuals display significant autocorrelations, this suggests that the model has not captured all temporal dependencies.  
2\. Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF): Similar to the ACF, the PACF of the residuals is analyzed to check for any unexplained serial correlations. The absence of significant spikes in the PACF plot indicates that no further AR terms are required in the model.  
3\. Ljung-Box Q-test: This statistical test checks whether the residuals are autocorrelated over a specified number of lags. The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no autocorrelation. A p-value greater than 0.05 suggests that the residuals do not exhibit significant autocorrelation, implying that the model is well-specified.

The Ljung-Box Q-statistic is calculated as:  
![][image102]                        *Equation 3.73*  
Where:

* pk  is the sample autocorrelation at lag k,  
* n is the number of observations,  
* m is the maximum lag used for the test.

If the p-value from the Ljung-Box Q-test is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the residuals behave like white noise and that the model has appropriately captured the temporal dependencies.

#### **C. Visualization of Error Patterns** {#c.-visualization-of-error-patterns}

Visual diagnostics help identify where and why forecast precision varies. These visuals complement statistical measures and provide intuitive insights into model performance

* Hourly Heatmap \- Reveals clusters of high forecast deviation by plotting residuals across time and hours of day.  
* Boxplots of Residuals by Appliance \- Compares the dispersion of residuals across appliances.  
* Temperature vs. Residual Error Scatter Plots \- Investigates the relationship between temperature and forecast errors.

## **3.6 System Implementation** {#3.6-system-implementation}

This section outlines the process of transforming validated per-appliance forecasting outputs into user-facing features: hourly cost estimation, budget monitoring, and alerting. It defines the necessary data inputs and outputs, equations, and the execution flow for both the web dashboard and mobile notification system. 

### **3.6.1 Cost Estimation Methodology** {#3.6.1-cost-estimation-methodology}

#### **A. Inputs and Time Base** {#a.-inputs-and-time-base}

	For each monitored appliance, hourly energy forecasts are generated for the next 24 hours, which forms a rolling horizon of predictions. These forecasts are measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and provide estimates of energy consumption for each appliance on an hourly basis. The system uses monthly tariff rates for each month in the billing cycle, which are measured in pesos per kilowatt-hour (₱/kWh). Each forecast hour is mapped to the applicable month, ensuring that the tariff rate is aligned with the specific month when the forecast is made.

#### **B. Hourly Cost Translation** {#b.-hourly-cost-translation}

	For each appliance and hour, the cost of energy consumption is calculated by multiplying the forecasted energy consumption for that hour by the applicable tariff rate for that month. The formula for the hourly cost of each appliance at each hour is given by:  
Cost=Eforecasted  tariff\_rate (depending monthly)        *Equation 3.74*

	Once the hourly cost is calculated, the cumulative cost for the appliance is determined by summing the total costs from the previous hours up to the current hour. This provides a running total for the day. The cumulative cost for the day at a specific hour is expressed as:  
Cumulative Cost=i=124Cost                                  *Equation 3.75*

As new hourly data arrives, the system recalculates the cost for the next hour and updates the cumulative cost for the appliance accordingly. For instance, when new data for hourt+1 is available, the system computes the next-hour forecast, then adds the new hourly cost to the cumulative total, ensuring that the forecast for the next 24 hours is always updated and available.

#### **C. Top-Consuming Appliances (Forecast Perspective)** {#c.-top-consuming-appliances-(forecast-perspective)}

	To identify the top-consuming appliance for the next 24 hours, appliances are sorted by their projected cost (or energy consumption) contribution over the upcoming hours, using the cumulative cost calculated earlier. The cumulative cost for each appliance over the 24-hour forecast horizon is computed by summing the individual hourly costs for each appliance, as explained in the earlier section. This cumulative cost represents the total energy cost that each appliance will contribute over the next 24 hours.

Once the cumulative cost for each appliance is computed, the appliances are ranked based on their total forecasted cost contribution for the next 24 hours. The top 1 appliance with the highest cumulative cost is identified and displayed on the dashboard. The system can also display the ranked appliance by the share of total forecasted energy or cost contributed by each appliance over the next 24-hour period, reflecting the sum of the cumulative costs for each appliance.

#### **D. System Artifacts** {#d.-system-artifacts}

The system generates three components to provide users with comprehensive energy consumption and cost insights: forecast outputs, a web-based dashboard, and mobile alerts.

1\. Forecast Outputs  
The system generates the following forecasting outputs:

* Hourly Forecasts \- These include energy consumption (in kWh) and cost (in ₱) for each appliance in the household.  
* Next 24-Hour Totals \- The system calculates the total projected energy consumption and cost for the next 24 hours.  
* Top Appliances \- Based on the forecasted energy consumption or cost, the system ranks the top-consuming appliances for the next 24 hours.

2\. Web Dashboard  
The system’s web dashboard prototype displays the following information:

* Historical vs. Forecasted Data \- Users can compare past energy consumption (kWh) and costs (₱) with forecasts.  
* 24-Hour Forecast Panels \- These panels show the energy consumption and cost projections for the next 24 hours.  
* Budget Status \- A budget status indicator (OK, At-risk, Exceeded) shows whether the household’s energy or cost usage is within set limits.  
* Top-Appliance Cards \- The dashboard highlights the top appliances contributing to energy consumption and cost.

3\. Mobile Alerts  
The system also provides mobile notifications for daily updates:

* Daily Summary of Forecast \- A summary of the forecasted energy consumption and costs for the next day (kWh, ₱) is sent to the user.  
* Top-Consuming Appliance Alert \- The system identifies and notifies users of the top-consuming appliance for the next 24 hours, included in the daily summary  
* Budget Alerts \- If the system detects that energy consumption or costs are nearing the user-defined budget limits, an alert is triggered.

### **3.6.2 Budget Threshold and Alert Engine** {#3.6.2-budget-threshold-and-alert-engine}

#### **A. Budget Constructs** {#a.-budget-constructs}

The system supports two complementary budget views to help users manage energy consumption and costs:

* Daily Per-Appliance Budget \- Users can assign a specific budget (in ₱ or kWh) to any monitored appliance based on forecasted and actual consumption.  
* Rolling 24-Hour Budget \- The same budget values can be applied to a rolling 24-hour period

The budget engine evaluates both the actual-to-date and forecast-to-go costs within the same day (or 24-hour window) to provide timely warnings about potential budget exceedances. For per-appliance budgets, the engine computes costs and energy consumption separately for each appliance, isolating the costs for individual appliances.

#### B. Status Logic {#b.-status-logic}

	At any given forecast origin, the system computes:

* Forecast-to-go cost \- This is the projected cost from time to the end of the day (or the next 24 hours). This value is based purely on the forecasted energy consumption and applicable tariff rates.

The projected daily total is calculated by summing the forecasted costs for the remaining hours of the day or the next 24 hours:  
Projected Daily  Total=t+124Forecasted Costt              *a*	

An optional caution margin can be applied (default is 90%) to trigger early warnings if the projected cost is approaching a predefined threshold:  
Warning Threshold=Projected Daily Total  Caution Margin  Equation 58

In the daily summary, the engine surfaces the next-hour forecasted cost and highlights the top-consuming appliance for the upcoming 24-hour period.

#### **C. Alert Policies** {#c.-alert-policies}

The Alert Policies are designed to notify users about energy consumption thresholds and to ensure they are informed when their energy usage is approaching or exceeding the set limits.  
1\. Threshold Breach (Projected)

* Actual cost exceeds the user-defined daily budget \- If the actual cost from the start of the day up to the current time has already surpassed the daily budget.

2\. Early Warning

* An early warning is triggered when the status changes to At-risk for the first time during the day. This is a proactive alert to warn users that their energy consumption or cost is nearing critical levels, allowing them time to take action.

3\. Quiet Hours and Summaries

* To respect users' time, notifications are paused during quiet hours. During this period, the system will not send alerts unless it’s urgent. Instead, a daily summary is sent in a user-specified time.

#### **D. Execution Schedule** {#d.-execution-schedule}

	The system operates on a structured execution schedule to ensure timely forecasting, alerts, and updates:  
1\. Batch Cadence

* The system runs a daily batch process once a day, between 23:00 and 23:10 (UTC+8). During this time, the system computes the forecasts for the next day, specifically for the time range \[00:00, 23:00\]. This allows the system to project the upcoming day's energy consumption and costs.

2\. Data Dependencies  
The system uses the following inputs for its calculations:

* The most recent, verified data on actual energy consumption.  
* The most up-to-date forecasts based on the SARIMAX model  
* The most recent tariff rates for accurate cost calculations.

The engine executes hourly for next-hour previews and runs a full daily batch process near 23:00 (UTC+8).

### **3.6.3 System Validation** {#3.6.3-system-validation}

To ensure the system’s forecasting accuracy and reliability, a structured validation process is followed using the following steps:

1\. Data Split and Protocol  
The data is divided using a 80% training / 20% testing chronological split. This ensures that the system is trained on historical data and tested on unseen future data. The rolling-origin protocol is applied to ensure that each forecast is tested against progressively newer data.  
2\. Procedure for Each Test Day

* On each test day, the deployed pipeline runs separately for each monitored appliance to generate the system’s 24-hour forecasts for both energy consumption (kWh) and cost (₱).  
* The system’s forecasts are then compared against actual recorded data using the following error metrics:  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)  
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)

3\. Cost Output Verification

* The resulting cost outputs are compared against a re-computed reference, such as the Meralco Appliance Calculator, with the requirement that any differences must be within machine precision (numerical parity check), ensuring the model’s cost predictions are accurate.

4\. Alert Verification

* Ground-truth exceedance is defined by comparing actual accumulated cost with forecast-to-go cost values at each forecast origin.  
* Alert precision and recall are measured:  
- Precision is the proportion of alerts that correspond to true exceedances.  
- Recall is the proportion of true exceedances that triggered an alert.

5\. Acceptance Thresholds  
The system is considered valid if it meets the following criteria during testing:

* MAPE \- The system’s MAPE should be within \+0.2 percentage points of the validated offline SARIMAX model.  
* Cost Parity \- The system must pass the cost parity check for 100% of hours in the test period.  
* Alert Precision \- The alert precision should be ≥ 0.95.  
* Alert Recall \- The alert recall should be ≥ 0.90.

### **3.6.4 Prototype** {#3.6.4-prototype}

The system prototype consists of a web-based dashboard and a mobile notification interface, both designed to present the forecasting outputs, cost estimation results, budget alerts, and top-appliance insights. Figure 3.4 shows the sample prototype developed during system implementation.  
**![][image103]**  
*Figure 3.5 Web-Based Dashboard of the Forecasting System*

This figure integrates outputs from the SARIMAX forecasting engine, tariff-based cost calculator, and budget evaluation logic into a single interactive view. Each component is designed to support short-term household energy awareness and decision-making based on forecasted usage.

A. Actual vs. Forecast Visualization Panel  
The dashboard features an overlapping line chart that displays appliance-level energy consumption over time. This chart compares actual historical usage and forecasted values on an hourly basis for the selected appliance. Users may toggle between appliances (e.g., electric fan, rice cooker, television) using a filter control.

This visualization allows users to observe how closely the forecasted consumption aligns with observed usage trends and provides a clear view of projected energy behavior over the next 24 hours.

B. Previous vs. Forecasted Usage Comparison  
A bar chart summarizes and compares total energy consumption for two periods:

* the previous 24-hour usage, and  
* the forecasted energy consumption for the next 24 hours.

This comparison enables users to quickly assess whether their expected energy usage is projected to increase or decrease relative to the recent past, supporting proactive energy management.

C. Forecast Controls Panel  
The dashboard includes a forecast control section that allows users to adjust key parameters used in cost estimation and budget evaluation. These controls include:

* Forecast horizon selection (1 hour to 24 hours),  
* Input of the applicable electricity tariff rate (₱/kWh),  
* User-defined daily or rolling budget value,  
* Appliance selection and management.

These controls allow the system to dynamically update forecast summaries, cost projections, and budget status indicators based on user input.

D. Appliances Consumption Ranking  
The Appliances Consumption Ranking panel displays an ordered list of monitored appliances based on their forecasted energy contribution for the next 24 hours. For each appliance, the dashboard shows:

* Estimated energy consumption (kWh), and  
* Corresponding projected cost (₱).

A total forecasted energy and cost value is also shown at the bottom of the panel. This component helps users identify which appliances are expected to contribute most to upcoming energy usage and expenses.

E. Energy Forecast Summary and Budget Status  
The Energy Forecast Summary panel provides a concise overview of key forecast metrics, including:

* Total forecasted energy consumption and cost for the next 24 hours,  
* Energy usage and cost from the previous 24-hour period,  
* Actual recorded usage and cost for the most recent day,  
* Identification of the top-consuming appliance,  
* Current budget status indicator

This summary allows users to quickly interpret their projected energy situation and budget standing without navigating through detailed charts.

F. Mobile Notification  
The prototype includes two types of mobile notification previews that demonstrate how forecast insights and budget-related alerts are communicated to users. The first type is the Daily Forecast Summary Notification, which presents the same forecasted energy consumption, cost estimates, top-consuming appliance, and budget status shown on the web dashboard, but in a simplified mobile-friendly format. Meanwhile, the second type is the Budget Threshold Warning Notification, which is event-driven and generated dynamically when the projected energy cost approaches or exceeds a predefined percentage of the user-defined daily budget. This notification provides an early warning to users, allowing them to take corrective action before an actual budget exceedance occurs.
